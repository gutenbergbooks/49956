<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In committing to print the subjoined record of the Cretan
revolt of 1866-7-8, I am fulfilling a duty in regard to
a series of events <i lang="la">quæque ipse vidi et quorum pars magna fui</i>,
and which, if not in themselves of importance, are so as
a revelation of the manner in which political influences
work in the East, and perhaps still more as a curious
exemplification of the weight which personal accidents,
private intrigue and pique, and the capacity or incapacity
of obscure officials, may have in determining the affairs of
great empires.</p>

<p>In taking the position I did with reference to the insurrection,
I was actuated only by a love of justice, and in no
wise by sentimental or religious prejudices; but I hope it
may be permitted me to say that, if I learned how fatal
are the defects of the Greek race, its bitterness in personal
rivalry, want of patriotic subordination, and the extravagance
of its political hostilities, I saw also that it possesses
admirable qualities, which the interests of civilization demand
the development of; high capacity for political organization,
for patriotic effort and self-sacrifice; and endurance
and equanimity under misfortunes, which few races
could endure and retain any character or coherence.
Their amiable and refined personal qualities, and their
private and domestic morality, have justified in me a feeling
towards them for which I was utterly unprepared on going
to the Levant, and give me a hope that the manifest lesson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
of the Cretan revolt may not be lost in their future, either
to them or to the friends of the better civilization. I feel
that the Hellenes are less responsible for the vices of their
body politic than their guardian Powers, who interfere to
misguide, control to pervert, and protect to enfeeble, every
good impulse and quality of the race, while they foster this
spirit of intrigue, themselves enter into the domestic politics
of Greece in order to be able to control her foreign, and
each in turn, lest Greece should some day be an aid to some
other of the contestants about the bed of the sick man, does
all it can to prevent her from being able to help herself.
No just and right-thinking man can make responsible for
its sins or misfortunes, a people which is denied the right
to shape its own institutions without a studied reference to
the prejudices of its protectors; to manage its own affairs
without the meddling of foreign ministers, who dictate who
shall be its administrators; to protect even its own constitution
against the violence and usurpation of an irresponsible
and incapable head, without the secret but efficacious intervention
of some foreign Power. A witness of every step
of the late diplomatic intervention in Greek foreign affairs, I
saw that in all the <i lang="fr">corps diplomatique</i> at Athens Greece had
not one friend&mdash;every one helped to push her into the
abyss; not one word of real sympathy or friendly counsel
did she find from any foreign representative. The United
States, which had, perhaps, more than any other nation
a powerful moral influence, and could have helped her by
wise words and calm and disinterested moral intervention,
had chosen to send as the dispenser of that influence the
most incapable, ignorant, and obsequious diplomat I have
ever known in the service of our Government&mdash;a man who
was an actual cipher in any political sense, and who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
on arriving in Greece (our first representative there), hastened
to mingle himself with the party intrigues of the
country, ranging himself on the side of the king, against
the people, in such a way that his advent was, to use the
words of one of the leading statesmen of Greece spoken to
me at the time, "like a wet blanket" to the hopes of
liberalism in Greece.</p>

<p>The Hellenes must learn that they have no friends, save
in the unprejudiced and charitable individuals who know
them well enough to be able to overlook their foibles and
petty vices, in view of the solid and genuine claims which
they have to our liking and the support of Christendom.
As one of those, I await the day when Greece shall have
been mistress of herself long enough to prove whether or
not she can govern herself wisely, before I lend my voice
to her blame for her failures or her offences.</p>

during the delay which has attended the publication of
this work, several of the personages mentioned in it, and
some whose character or conduct is severely criticised,
have died. This explanation will relieve the author of the
appearance either of bad taste or of vindictiveness; while
to the fact that he was unable to give his personal supervision
to the work in passing through the press are due the
errata which may be discovered, and an occasional want
of uniformity in the spelling of proper names.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A student of classical ethnology, curious to
restore the antique man, can do no better, so far
as the Greek variety is concerned, than to go to
Crete and study its people. The Cretan of to-day preserves
probably the character of antiquity, and holds to his
ancient ways of feeling and believing, and, within the new
conditions, as far as possible of acting, more nearly than
would be believed possible, and affords a better field of investigation
into the nature of the classical man than any
existing records.</p>

<p>The island is one of those paradisiacal isolations which
facilitate civilization in its early stages, and preserve it from
the encroachments of progress in the later. Its low latitude
secures it against cold in winter, and its insular position
against extreme heat, while the range of high mountains running
longitudinally through it gives its climate a salubrity possessed
by no section of the world's surface so near the sun.
The standard summer temperature is from 82° to 86°
Fahr., and once only in a residence of nearly four years I saw
it as high as 92°. The minimum was 52°. Wild flowers
never are wanting except in midsummer. The almond
blooms in February (I have seen it in blossom on Christmas),
and all the known fruits follow it in succession, each
finding some locality and climate suited to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The fertility of the plains, and the inaccessibility of its
mountain fastnesses, made prosperity easy and conquest difficult,
while its remoteness from the shore of either continent
made ancient invasion not easy, and preserved the type of
the composite Greek race from the barbaric innovations of
Greece proper, so that we have the Greek race of <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 700
undoubtedly more purely preserved than anywhere else.</p>

<p>Only in prosperity and weight in mundane matters, in
comparative consideration, they have passed to the other
end of the scale from that in which Homer could say of
their land: "There is a country, Crete, in the midst of the
black sea, beautiful and fertile, wave-washed roundabout,
with a population infinite in number, and ninety cities.
The races are different, and with different languages&mdash;there
are Achæans, there are the huger Eteocretans,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> the Cydonians,
the crest-waving Dorians, and the divine Pelasgi.
Theirs is Gnossus, a great city, and theirs is King Minos,
who talked nine years with great Jove."</p>

<p>This enumeration has evidently no relation to chronological
order, and unfortunately we have no intelligible
traditions as to the order of settlement in Crete. Diodorus
Siculus says that "the first inhabitants of Crete dwelt in
the neighborhood of Mount Ida, and were called the Idæan
Dactyls." But Scylax says that, according to early Greek
tradition, Cydonia (in the western end of the island) was
known as "the mother of cities." Its position and character
of site indicate rather a settlement of Pelasgi coming
from the west.</p>

<p>Spratt finds in the geological record clear evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the Greek Archipelago having been formerly a fresh-water
lake or series of lakes, and, if this be true, Crete must have
been connected with the main lands of Europe and Asia
Minor, in which case the aboriginal inhabitants would be a
land migration, probably from Aryan sources. That a
Phrygian colony known as the Idæan Dactyls brought here
knowledge of certain arts and religious mysteries, and
became to the people with whom they mingled, semi-divine,
appears probable. The subsequent visit of the Tyrian
Hercules, who, on his way to get the cattle of Geryon,
called here as the rendezvous of his forces, and, to recompense
the Cretans for their friendship, purged the island of
wild beasts, may indicate a Phœnician colony or passing
expedition.</p>

<p>But admitting, as of possibility, that the Eteocretan was
a land emigration, cavern-dwelling, as the abundance of
the caves in the island suggests; a collation of all the traditions
makes it probable that the first important immigration
was Pelasgic, and from the Italian shores, noted in many
Greek traditions as the Tyrrhenian Pelasgi (Etruscans?),
whose colonies came down by the Morea and the isles of
Cerigo and Cerigotto by easy journeys to Crete. [The records
of Karnak show that, in the reign of Thotmes III., a
great migration of Cretan Pelasgi came into Egypt, and
became the Philistines (Pilisti or Pilisgi); proving that at this
early period the hive was so full that it had begun to swarm.]</p>

<p>This first immigration became, if my conjecture goes to
the mark, the Cydonian stock&mdash;the subsequent one which
Homer speaks of as Pelasgic, being of much later date;
the Dorian, which was of the highest importance in its effect,
as finally assimilating or subjecting all other races, and
the Achæan, a scarcely influential influx, coming within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
recognized traditions. The author of the "Isles of Greece"
supposes two aboriginal races in the island, a needless multiplication
of "original Adams," though an Asiatic or
Phrygian race coming in at the east, and a Pelasgic at the
west, seem to have been the first recognizable elements in
the population.</p>

<p>The myth of Jupiter and Europa is regarded as concealing
the history of the introduction of the worship of the
moon by a Phœnician colony, who, combining with the
population of the eastern end of the island, whose peculiar
deity was Jupiter, produced the race over which Minos
came to rule, from this fabled to be the son of Jupiter and
Europa. The journey of Europa along the river Lethe
indicates the course of this colony to the capital of Minos,
Gortyna, which more anciently had borne the name of
Larissa, a Pelasgic name, from which we might conjecture
that it was founded by the colony of Teutamos, who, with
a band of Dorians, Achæans, and Pelasgi, the builders of
all the early Greek cities, is said by the early historians to
have arrived in Crete three centuries before the Trojan
war, and to have settled in the eastern part of the island,
and given the early city its Pelasgic name.</p>

<p>The present inhabitants betray differences of character
so great as almost to indicate difference of race. The
Sphakiotes are larger of build, more restless and adventurous,
thievish and inconstant, turbulent and treacherous,
than the people of any other section. The Seliniotes, in
the western extremity, are the bravest of the Cretans, but
less turbulent or quarrelsome, not given to stealing, and of
good faith. In the eastern end, especially the region of Gortyna
and Gnossus, the blessings of the rule of Minos seem to
rest in pacific natures. The great Dorian invasion, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
1,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, gave the island a dominant caste, uniformity of
language and customs, but without complete fusion of races.</p>

<p>The language of Crete to-day is a Dorian dialect, and
preserves many characteristics noted by the ancient authors.
The use of <em>Kappa</em> as <em>c</em> is used in Italian, either hard
or soft (in terminal syllables generally the latter), the use of
<em>r</em> for <em>l</em>, especially with the Sphakiotes, and the presence of
many words in modern Cretan which have disappeared
from modern continental Greek, with a comparative rareness
of Turkish words, and entire absence of Albanian and
Sclavonic, show how much less the Cretans have been
affected by outside influences than other parts of the Greek
community. I give a few of the words which retain their
ancient form more closely than on the continent:</p>

<p>There are few Turkish words in use, and those mainly
of objects brought by the Turks: βουδαλά, a lubber; τσιμπούχι,
a pipe; τουφέκι, a gun, etc. A few Italian: καπιτανός, captain;
βετέμα (<i lang="it">vendemmia</i>), olive crop; βίστατο (guastato); ματινάδα, a
song, and some names of implements, with idioms which
cling, as the use of πίυ, the comparative, instead of τέρος.</p>

<p>There is a trace of genuine Cretan literature, though its
chief work, the "Erotókritos," is by an Italian colonist,
Vincenzo Cornaro. They have, however, many songs and
many bards, though to any but Cretan ears the music is far
from agreeable. I knew one of the popular singers, Karalambo,
poet and singer at once, as most of them are (and
many are <i lang="it">improvisatori</i> of considerable facility). He was
so much in repute that no wedding or festivity was considered
complete anywhere in the range of a day's ride from
Canéa unless Karalambo was there; and at other times he
used to sing in the cafés on the Marina, screaming, to the
strain of a naturally fine tenor, songs which, though to me
not even music, used to melt his audiences into tears. He
was a patriot as well as poet, and when the insurrection of
'66 actually broke out, his songs were so seditious, and ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>cited
the Khaniote Christians so much, that he was driven
into the mountains, and, joining a band of his neighbors,
was one day wounded by the accidental discharge of a
pistol one of his comrades was cleaning. The wound was
fatal from want of surgical attendance.</p>

<p>The Cretan music is always of a plaintive character, and
monotonous; in singing, they have a habit of incessant
quavering, and this, with the drawling tone, makes it far
from agreeable to an ear accustomed to cultivated music,
but it has a decided character of its own.</p>

<p>There were in Kalepa before the insurrection two <i lang="it">improvisatori</i>
of considerable repute, who were accustomed to
carry on musical disputes, one singing a couplet, and the
other replying in a similar one. Sometimes it was a match
of compliments, and sometimes the reverse, but following
with tolerable exactitude the metre, a four-lined stanza, the
second and fourth lines rhyming. All the ballads I have
seen are in this form, the music also differing but little to
my ear, though possibly to a Cretan there may be wide
differences.</p>

<p>The Cretans possess, in common with all the Greeks, the
avidity for instruction and quickness of intellect which
make of this race the dominant element in the Levant.
They are tenaciously devoted to their religion and to their
traditions, which have kept them up and preserved the
national character against such a continuation of hostile
influences as probably no other people ever lived through.
The history of Crete is a series of obstinate rebellions and
barbarous repressions, since the first conquest by the Saracens
in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 820, a conquest which was followed by an
almost complete apostasy from Christianity&mdash;sword-conversion,
and by persistent attempts on the part of the Byzantine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
emperors to reconquer it, until 961, when Nikephoras
Phocas succeeded in driving the Saracens out. They seem
to have made no considerable addition to the Cretan stock,
since the population rapidly returned to Christianity, to
which, judging from the known and more recent past, they
had always probably remained devoted at heart. At the
division of the Byzantine empire, Crete passed to Boniface,
Duke of Montserrat, and from him was purchased by the
Venetian Republic, 1204, from which time till its conquest
by the Turks, completed in 1669, the Cretans were under
a yoke that would probably have depopulated any other
section of the Old World. The cruelties and misgovernment
of the governors sent from Venice would be incredible
if not recorded by Venetian historians and official records.
The Venetians seem to have regarded the Cretans much in
the same light as the English colonists of America did the
Indians, and, when their wretched state came to the
knowledge of the Senate, they sent commissioners to
examine into it, from whose reports I translate some extracts
(quoted in Italian by Pashley), who took them from the original
documents in the public library of Venice. Basadonna,
the first of these officers whose reports remain, says (1566):
"The tax-gatherers and others dependent on them use
against these unhappy people, in one way and another,
strange and horrible tyrannies. It would be a matter
worthy of your clemency immediately to abolish so odious
and barbarous exactions, since to maintain them is to
abandon these wretched men to most cruel serpents, who
lacerate and devour them entirely, or oblige the few of
them who remain to escape into Turkey, following the footsteps
of innumerable others who, from time to time, have
gone away from this cause." Then from Garzoni (1586):<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
"In all the villages in which I have been, I have seen the
houses of the inhabitants, in the greater part of which
there is not be seen any article for the uses of dress or
table; and for food, they are without bread or corn; they
have no wine; their women are despoiled, their children
naked, the men slightly covered, and the house emptied
of everything, without any sign of human habitation.
And this wretched people ('<i lang="it">quella meschinità de' huomini</i>')
is compelled by established custom to give to the cavaliers
two 'angarie' [twelve days' work] each per annum, and is
obliged also by ancient regulation to work as much more
as the cavalier may need for the pay of eight soldini a
day, which amounts to a 'gazetta' [two Venetian soldi,
or about one penny] and a fifteenth, introduced by them
two hundred years ago, and not since increased. They
are obliged to keep chickens and hens according to the
number of doors [I do not feel sure of having properly
translated this expression, obscure in the original], their
masters having applied the term of doors to houses,
which are built by the peasants themselves, and have
no kind of use of doors, because the Cavaliers, industrious
for their own advantage, make doors as
frequently as possible to increase the number of royalties.
The beasts of labor, called donnegals, are obliged to
plough a certain quantity of land, for which, planted or
not, the peasant must pay the third. The donnegals are
also obliged to work two angarie per annum. Mules and
other beasts of transport must make two voyages to the
city for the master. Animals of pasture the tenth, and
a thousand other inventions to absorb all the productions
of the land. If the peasant has a vineyard planted (the
ground always belonging to the Cavaliers) and trained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
him, although on land before wild, he must pay to the
master, before marking the division for the royalty (which
by ancient regulation gives one-third to the Cavalier and
two to the peasant), five measures, called <em>mistaches</em>, for
each vineyard, under pretext that he has eaten part before
the vintage, for the use of the <em>pattichier</em> [in Crete, even
now, an open shallow kind of vat built in the fields, of
flat stones, and cemented, in which the grapes are trampled],
and under other most dishonest inventions. And to
increase still more the royalty, they divide the vineyard
into so many parts that few return more than fifteen <em>mistaches</em>,
in such a way that with fraud founded on force they
take two-thirds for themselves and give one to the peasant.</p>

<p>"There are chosen for judges of their country, as I have
said, Castellans&mdash;writers who serve as secretaries (<i lang="it">cancellieri</i>);
and 'Captains to look after the robbers,' who all
set rapaciously to rob these poor people, taking what
little any of them may have hidden from the Cavaliers
under pretext of disobedience, in which the peasant
abounds, by reason of his desperation, so that he is in
every way wretched. The Castellans cannot by law judge
the value of more than two sequins, although by some
regulation they are allowed authority to the sum of two
hundred <em>perperi</em>, about fourteen sequins; and because they
have eight per cent. for the charges they make, all causes
amount to two hundred <em>perperi</em>, however small it may be,
in order to get their sixteen of charges, with thousand other
inventions of extortion to eat up the substance of the
poor. The Captains, whose name indicates their functions,
have their use from robberies, and always find means to
draw their advantage from the same, plundering the good
and releasing the guilty, to the universal ruin.... The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
men chosen for the galleys are in continual terror of going,
and those who have the means, with whatever difficulty,
from some vineyard, or land, or animals, throw all away unhesitatingly
for a trifling price to pay for their dispensation,
which costs fifteen or twenty sequins&mdash;expense which they
cannot support. The poorest, hopeless of their release, fly
to the mountains, and thence, reassured by the Cavaliers,
return to their villages, so much the more enslaved as they
are fearful of justice, and by their example make the other
villagers more obedient, attributing to the Cavaliers the
power of saving them from the galleys.... To
which, add the extortions to which they are subjected
by a thousand accidental circumstances, execution of
civil debts, visits of rectors and other officers, to whom
they are obliged to give sustenance at miserable prices....
So that the peasantry, oppressed in this manner,
and harassed in so many ways, annoyed by the reasonings
of the Papists, and made enemies of the Venetian name,
... are so reduced by the influences I have enumerated,
that I believe I can say with truth that, with the exception
of the privileged classes, they desire a change of
government, and though they know they cannot fall into
other hands than those of the Turks, yet, believing they
cannot make worse their condition, incline even to their
tyrannical rule."</p>

<p>I extract from the opinion of Fra Paolo Sarpi (1615), a
more Jesuitical, and, it would seem, more palatable advice
to the Senate, since it was, in the end, and to the end
followed: "For your Greek subjects of the island of
Candia, and the other islands of the Levant, ... the
surest way is to keep good garrisons to awe them, and
not use them to arms or musters, in hope of being as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>sisted
by them in extremity; for they will always show ill
inclination proportionably to the strength they shall be
musters of.... Wine and bastinadoes ought to be
their share, and keep good nature for a better occasion....
If the gentlemen of these colonies do tyrannize
over the villages of their dominion, the best way is not
to seem so see it, that there may be no kindness between
them and their subjects; but, if they offend in anything
else, it will be well to chastise them severely, etc....
And in a word, remember that all the good that can come
from them is already obtained, which was to fix the
Venetian dominion, and for the future there is nothing
but mischief to be expected from them."</p>

<p>What a pity that Sarpi had not lived before Dante,
that he might have been niched in the "Inferno":</p>

<p class="center">
"Questo é de' rei del fuoco furo."
</p>

<p>I have only space to epitomize a passage of the history
of Crete, under the Venetians, to show how utterly infamous,
unjust, and <em>devilish</em> was their <em>régime</em>. In the beginning
of the sixteenth century, the provinces of Selino, Sfakia,
and Rhizo seceded, and established an independent government,
which was for some time unmolested by the
Venetian authorities. The governor of the seceded republic
finally presuming to ask in marriage for his son the
daughter of a Venetian noble, the latter, to revenge the
insult, plotted with the governor of Canéa, and, pretending
to consent, lured the family of the soi-disant Greek
governor, with a company of nearly 500 of his compatriots,
to the marriage feast. The guests having been
intoxicated and gone to sleep, and the signal given to the
authorities at Canéa, the governor came with 1,700 foot
and 150 horse, took the whole prisoners, and in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
ways and different places massacred them, except a few
who were sent to the galleys.</p>

<p>This was followed up, for the better terrifying of the
seditious, by a raid on the village of Foligniaco, near
Murnies, and on the edge of the plain of Canéa, in which
they took the whole population prisoners asleep, burned
the village, hanged twelve of the primates, ripped open
three or four pregnant women, wives of the principal
people, put to death and exiled the whole population
remaining, except five or six who escaped. The Provveditore
then called on all the Greeks of the lately revolted
district to come in and surrender themselves, but, as they
naturally declined, they were put under a ban which is
perhaps the most horrible sentence ever given by a <em>civilized</em>
community. No inhabitant of the proscribed district could
secure his life except on condition of bringing in the
"head of his father, brother, cousin, or nephew."</p>

<p>"At length a priest of the family of the Pateri-Zapa
entered the city, accompanied by his two sons and by two
of his brothers, each of the mournful party carrying in his
hand a human head. (Of the five heads, the first belonged
to the son of the priest, the second to one of his brothers,
the third to his son-in-law, and the fourth and fifth to sons
of one of his brothers.) The wretched men placed their
bleeding offerings before the Signor Cavalli and the other
representatives of Venice, and with the bitterest tears
stated whose heads they were. The facts were duly established
by witnesses; even the governor who had been sent
to Crete to extirpate the seditious Greeks was moved, and
the law was at length abolished."</p>

<p>This was under the auspices of Christianity. Under the
Crescent, things were at first better, but finally such as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
cause wonder how there is still a Cretan people, considering
that even Dante could say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Nel mezzo 'l mar siede un paese guasto<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Diss' egli allora, che s'appella Creta."<br /></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Venetian rule had reduced the population of the
island to about 160,000, the tenth of its probable number
under the Byzantine emperors. The anticipations of
Garzoni were to the full realized, for the Cretan, favoring
the Turkish conquest, made it possible, and avenged
himself in the way of the weak. The Turks, in recompense
for the important assistance rendered them by the
Cretans, exempted them from conscription or military tax,
but learned no lesson from their conquered enemies, and,
until the cession of the island to Egypt in 1830, Crete was
the scene of the most unbridled license of individuals and
fanaticism of sects.</p>

<p>In passing from the Venetian to the Turkish despotism
the Cretans had exchanged bad for worse. The Venetian
was oppressive to the last degree in pecuniary extortions, but
the Turk brought in slavery of another form&mdash;the harem and
all its horrors to a captive people, even then celebrated for
the beauty of its women. The Turkish rule has never been,
and probably never will be, anything but piracy&mdash;the rule of
the strong hand. The great object of government was to
wring from the governed the largest possible amount of
plunder; it is so still. No motive of civilized government has
ever yet entered into the head of the Ottoman. The development
of a country's resources, even to increase its revenues,
has never been thought of. A race of nomad conquerors,
holding the land as if it waited the trumpet that should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
expel it, and could only reap where its predecessors had
planted, but never from its own sowing, it has extorted,
butchered, and enslaved, without leaving behind it more
than its bones to fertilize the soil. The noble public works
which marked the Venetian <em>régime</em> in Crete were allowed
to fall into decay, the walls of the cities show the shot-holes
made by the siege-guns, only filled up when it was necessary
to keep the wall from falling.</p>

<p>Of the early period of Turkish rule in Crete we know
little. Pirates keep no record; and the only insurrection of
any note we hear of was that of 1770, which seems to have
been mainly a Sphakiote affair, and to have resulted, on the
whole, favorably for the mountaineers, from their having
been allowed to maintain a virtual independence, as up to
1860 no Turkish garrison was ever permitted in Sphakia.
The fortress of Samaria has not been, in the records of
modern history, penetrated by an enemy in arms.</p>

<p>From 1770 to 1821, the condition of Crete was that of a
man on the rack. The conquests and the advantages of
apostasy had induced many Christians to become Mussulmans;
others followed from the bitter persecutions which began
soon after the insurrection of 1770, and made the life
of the Christian in the plains utterly intolerable. The former
class generally became, <i lang="la">ipso facto</i>, fanatical persecutors of
their late fellow-Christians, and the children or grandchildren
of the converts became oblivious of their ancestors'
creed and relations, and as, under the Koran, they lapsed
into a more complete ignorance than the Christians, they
soon became as fanatic as any. The influx of Turks was
never considerable, but the Cretan Mussulmans, becoming
the governing class, disposed of the lives and properties of
their Christian fellow-countrymen entirely at their will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Their agas, or chiefs, by force of character became captains
of bands of these Janissaries, as they were called, and established
a sway beside which the Venetian was a bed of feathers.
The Venetian was inhuman; the Janissary was devilish. I
have known several men who lived in the island while the
Janissary government was in full force, and who have testified
to me of the occurrence of such horrors as no system
of slavery known since the establishment of Christianity can
show. Every rayah (beast or domesticated animal) was
utterly at the mercy of his aga, who could kill, rob, or torture
him at will, without responsibility before any law, or
any obligation towards him. If the aga wanted money, he
went to any rayah he suspected of being possessed of any,
and ordered him to hand it over. If he wanted work done,
he ordered the rayah to do it. If he fancied the rayah's
wife or daughter, he went to his house, and ordered the man
out of it until his lust was satisfied, and if any resisted he
was killed like a dog. If a Christian celebrated his nuptials
with a girl of great beauty, he received from the aga a handkerchief
with a bullet tied in the corner of it, and if he did
not at once send his bride to the aga he paid the penalty
with his life. The only resource was to fly to the mountains
before the aga had time to send his men to seize him.
Most of the beautiful girls and women were sent to the
mountains as a precaution, which is probably one reason
why the women of the higher mountain districts are so
much more beautiful than those of the lowlands.</p>

<p>The Janissaries even ruled the governors sent by the Sultan,
and deposed or assassinated them when they did not
please. Needless to say that the poor islanders had no
hope of justice as against their tyrants. It was forbidden
to any Christian except the archbishop to enter the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
gates on horseback, and, the Bishop of Canéa having transgressed
this law, the Janissaries took him prisoner, and determined
to burn him and all his priests. About to carry
out this decision, the Pasha intervened, and to pacify them
issued an order that no Christian man should sleep in the
walls of Canéa, and accordingly the whole adult male population
was mustered out every night, leaving their wives and
children in the city. There is hardly room to wonder that
the Cretan is still a liar, rather wonder that he is still a man,
with courage to revolt and die, considering that only one
generation has intervened between him and a slavery more
abject than any domestic servitude the civilized world
knows of.</p>

<p>The oppression became more and more brutal and blind,
and the Cretans, crushed and stupefied, thought of nothing
but saving life by the most abject submission. Even when
the agitation which led to the Greek war of independence
began, the Cretans were not moved; but in June of 1821,
the Mussulmans massacred a large number of Christians,
some thousands, in the three principal cities. This was
followed up by a demand that all the Christians should
give up their arms, a demand which was followed by the
revolt of Sphakia, the mountaineers having never consented
to this degradation. The rising of the district about Ida
followed, and the war was so vigorously carried on that in
a month the open country was almost entirely cleared of
Mussulmans.</p>

<p>This stage of the war developed a man whose name has
become one of the historical in Crete, Antoni Melidoni.
Collecting a small band of bold men, he swept from one
end of the island to the other, falling on the negligently
guarded posts, and taking them by storm in rapid succes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>sion.
His hardihood knew no impossibilities, disparity of
numbers made no difference in his calculations, he measured
moral forces alone, and flung his sword and name into the
scale against any opposing numerical force. Surrounded
at night by superior forces, he led a charge sword in hand
on the hostile circle, broke it, and drove the Pasha's army
from the field, not permitting its disordered masses to
re-form until the walls of Candia sheltered them. A detachment
that made a sortie to attack him was destroyed, and
another victory following this, the Pasha of Candia, expressing
admiration of his prowess, begged to be favored with
an interview. The Cretan hero, trusting himself to no
temptation, treachery, or delay, replied that the Pasha
would soon be his prisoner, and that then he might look
at him as much as he liked. And the prophet fulfilled the
prediction to the letter.</p>

<p>So far, however, Christian and Turk fought on equal terms.
No discipline entered on either side&mdash;the Janissary fought the
partisan, and the superior enthusiasm of liberty turned the
scale in favor of the Christian. They had yet to meet
their strongest foes&mdash;internal dissension and disciplined
force. The first did its work quickly, and Melidoni was
assassinated by Russos, the Sphakiote chief, in jealousy of
his dominant influence. A Moreote chieftain, Afendallos,
was sent from Greece to replace him, but, incapable and
without control of the Cretans, his command was in every
way unfortunate, and he was superseded by a French Philhellene
of ability, Baleste, who for a moment restored the
fortunes of Crete, but, deserted by the wretched Afendallos
in the heat of battle, and the Cretans being carried away in
panic by the example, Baleste was surrounded by the Turks
and killed. At the same time, an Egyptian army coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
in to reinforce the exhausted and demoralized Janissaries,
the war became for the Christians a series of disasters,
relieved for a time by the management of Tombasis, a Hydriote
chief, who again cleared the open country of the Turks,
and laid siege to Canéa. The arrival of new forces from
Constantinople obliged him to retire to the highlands, and
an Egyptian fleet arriving debarked a fresh army, which,
marching into the interior, surprised a great number of
villages, and in a single raid put to the sword nearly 20,000
men, women, and children. Tombasis, watching his opportunity,
fell on a small detachment of Egyptians, and cut
them to pieces. The Christians rallied, and, swarming
down from the mountains, assailed the retiring army with
such fury that they killed 7,000 men.</p>

<p>A new Egyptian expedition of 10,000 troops with a large
squadron reinforced the Ottoman army, and the commander,
Ismail Gibraltar, so-called from having been the
first Turk to sail beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, an able,
adroit, and comparatively humane man, began to assail the
Sphakiotes on their weak side, and induced them by
bribery to withdraw from the hostilities. The other districts,
many times decimated, had not the force to maintain
the struggle, and Tombasis, after making a vain effort
to rally the elements of another struggle, abandoned the
island, which submitted almost entirely. Thousands of the
most devoted and patriotic Cretans went to Greece, where
they fought bravely for the common nationality. We see
still on the plains of Athens the tomb of the corps that
perished there to a man refusing to turn their backs to the
Turk.</p>

<p>After the battle of Navarino, the insurrection broke out
anew; an expedition from Greece under Kalergis captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Grabusa by stratagem, Kissamos was taken by siege; soon
the Cretan Mussulmans (the regular Egyptian forces being
engaged in the Morea) were shut up again in the three fortresses
of Canéa, Retimo, and Candia, and would soon, in
all probability, either have abandoned the island or have
perished in it, had not the three allied powers decided that
Crete should be united to the government of Mehemet Ali,
and notified their decree to the Christian population.
(Pashley, "Historical Introduction to Travels in Crete.")</p>

<p>The establishment of the Egyptian <em>régime</em> was at first productive
of great relief to the Christian population, as Mehemet
Ali had shrewdness enough to comprehend that their oppression
would be the disfavor of the Christian powers, now for
the first time clearly recognized to be mistresses of the
fortunes of the Ottoman Empire, and to perceive that for
material prosperity the Christian element was far more
available than the Mussulman, corrupted and degraded by
long unchecked and unmeasured abuse of power, and dependence
on servitude of others, the most hopeless of all
slavery. Order was re-established, and political organization,
which Crete had never known, was introduced, exiles
began to return, and all promised a better <em>régime</em> than any
Cretan could have hoped for under foreign rule.</p>

<p>The Pasha, in his designs of obtaining complete independence,
saw also that he must some day count the Turkish
population of Crete as his enemies; all these causes combined
gave the Christians an advantage over the Mussulman
element. After a time, however, the pirate's instincts took
the predominance, and Mehemet Ali, well assured of his
possession, began to measure the capacity of the island for
extortion of taxes. The promises made at the time of
pacification were unheeded, imposts succeeded each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
until the population, alarmed, had recourse to their immemorial
expedient of an assembly, and, several thousand
strong, Christian and Mussulman alike, they met at
Murnies, unarmed and accompanied by their families.
This habit of so assembling has from ancient times played
an important part in the history of Crete, and was known
as Syncretism. To this day, every crisis and every important
measure referring to the general welfare is discussed
in a full assembly of deputies of the whole population.</p>

<p>The assembly of Murnies was peaceful; <em>no one</em> brought
his arms, no violence of any kind was perpetrated on any
interest or person. The assembly petitioned the <em>protecting
powers</em> for redress and the fulfilment of the promises made
at their submission, but the indifference of the <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i>
Christian powers to everything that implied the rights of
the subject had already descended on the Greeks, so lately
emancipated by the "untoward event;" and the French and
English residents at Alexandria, more charmed by Egyptian
music than the claims of justice, heard what was agreeable to
the Viceroy, and the English agent even advised him to
make an example of insubordination which should save him
any future trouble. So encouraged, the arbiter of life or
death to this brave people sent orders to execute a number
of persons, both Christian and Mussulman. The Governor,
Mustapha Pasha, now known as Mustapha Kiritli (Cretan),
a hard and barbarous Albanian, bred in the brutalities
of the long wars with the Christians, readily complied, and
seized a number of persons at Canéa indifferently. At the
same time, the same orders were sent to other provinces,
and a general and simultaneous execution took place.
Many of the victims had no connection with the assembly,
nor does the number or quality seem to have been fixed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
The Albanian butcher caught the spirit of his master's order,
and hanged at random. Pashley says that thirty-three
were hanged, but perhaps he had a desire to diminish the
enormity of the deed for which he declares the English
agent at Alexandria to have been largely responsible.
Residents at Canéa at that time have assured me that over
eighty were hanged at Murnies, and the then Austrian consul
at Canéa has repeatedly declared to me that there were
several hundred victims, and that he himself had seen the
bodies hanging on the trees of Murnies, until the whole air
round was infected by them. This was in 1833, and until
1840 the Butcher held the island tranquil under the rod of
his menace.</p>

<p>In 1840, insurrectionary movements took place, which
were attributed to English influence, and said to be encouraged
by the English admiral at Suda. I have heard from
residents at Canéa<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> (non-Cretan) that the admiral facilitated
the introduction of muskets and ammunition, and
advised the chiefs to ask for an English protection. This
proposition was favored at the assembly of that occasion,
but the Turkish authorities secured its rejection by persuading
secretly the chiefs that their choice would be between
annexation to Greece and English protection, and
as, of course, they preferred the former, the project was
unanimously rejected, having secured which, and the consequent
English indifference, Mustapha, by an energetic
blow, suppressed the movement.</p>

<p>In 1858, a similar crisis was made use of by the French
government, whose agent openly took the part of the insurgents,
bullied the authorities, and encouraged the Cre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>tans
to look for French support. The assembly was held
at Nerokouro, and petitioned the Sultan for relief from
the most weighty grievances of the population. It was at
once determined to suppress the movement, like the former,
by force, but disturbances breaking out in the Christian
provinces of Turkey, and the attitude of France causing
distrust, the Porte finally yielded, made the concessions
demanded, and the assembly broke up. This outbreak
was remarkable for one incident which may have had
much to do with the solution arrived at. The government
had determined to obtain from its adherents an
address in opposition to that of the assembly, and it was
considered needful to have the signature of the Bishop of
Canéa.</p>

<p>This prelate, one of the most worthy and pious bishops
Crete has had in modern times, refused to sign, and compulsion
was applied, the Bishop being shut up in a room
with the council, and a pen put into his hand and applied
to the paper by force. But he resisted all pressure, declaring
that, if they killed him, he would not sign what he
knew to be a falsehood. This contest of will lasted
hours, when the physique of the Bishop gave way, and
he fainted, not having yielded. He was carried to his
house in great excitement, which rapidly spread and increased,
until he died in the course of the day. The
Cretans regarded him as a martyr, and his death fired
them with still greater enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Never was moment more favorable for insurrection; and
that the Cretans contented themselves with such moderate
demands as the relief of some of the newest and most
oppressive taxes, and yielded <em>on the promise only</em> of redress,
dispersing quietly to their homes, shows that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
were not, as they were represented by unfriendly writers,
disposed to factiousness and insurrection.</p>

<p>The promises made in 1858 were never fulfilled&mdash;if
there is honor amongst thieves, there is none amongst
Turks; and when, at the death of Abdul Medjid, his
successor, Abdul Aziz, was reminded of the promises
made to the Cretans, he replied that he was not bound
by the engagements of his predecessors, and Cretan reforms
lapsed into the abyss of good (and bad) intentions.
From that time the island was moved by discontent. The
next governor, Ismail, a clever, cunning Greek renegade,
charlatan in everything but intrigue, of the worst possible
faith and honesty, avaricious, mendacious, and cruel, but
plausible and persuasive, succeeded in delaying agitation by
promises and bribes, by dividing the chiefs one against the
other, till 1864, when another assembly was held, and
another petition drawn up and delivered to the governor
to be forwarded to Constantinople, when the assembly
dispersed. Ismail immediately convoked an assemblage of
his adherents, and had a counter-petition forwarded, assuring
the Porte of the perfect content of the Cretans
with their governor and their state. The true petition
was never heard of again, but the bearers of the
false one received the Medjidieh, and Ismail the thanks
of the Sultan, with presents which he valued much
more.</p>

<p>The ensuing winter was one of great distress, and the
spring passed without renewal of the disturbances or petitions,
but in the autumn of that year, after my arrival in
the island, I heard that there would be an assembly the
following spring, 1866. The discontent was very great.
New taxes on straw, on the sale of wine, on all beasts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
burden, oppressive collection of the tithes, together with
short crops for two years in succession, had produced very
great distress, and the Governor added to these grievances
his own extortions, with the most shameful venality in the
distribution of justice, and disregard of such laws of procedure
and punishment as existed. The councils were absolute
mockeries, and the councillors his most servile tools.
The summer of my arrival, I was told by the surgeon of
the civil hospital of a death that had just occurred under
his care, in prison, of an old man, arrested for an offence
which his son had committed, and because the son could
not be found.</p>

<p>Men accused of offences by Ismael's partisans were thrown
into prison, and kept indefinite periods without trial until
some friend went to bribe his accuser. Ismael never went
out into the island for fear of assassination, so well did he
know the hatred borne him. This was the state of the
island when I arrived in 1865.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">There was an annual fair at Omalo in the
month of April, and I had intended to make
this the occasion of a journey through
Sphakia. The Pasha was very earnest in counselling
me not to go, and magnifying difficulties for the
passage; but this only made me more disposed to go,
if only to cross his humor, as he had been exceedingly
annoying to me, and we carried on a polite war, defensive
on my side, but on his, part of a systematic course of bullying
the consuls in order to diminish their influence with the
people. His tactics were to encourage infractions of the
consular prerogatives, imprison their employees or protégés,
make questions at the custom-house, etc. He had, immediately
after my arrival, got up a question with me, a patrol
of zapties (Albanian police) having entered the consulate
to seize and carry off one of the sons of the vice-consul,
who resided in the consulate.</p>

<p>I demanded an apology, which he refused. We then
exchanged sharp notes, first in French, and then on his
part in Turkish, to which I replied in English&mdash;a mutual
checkmate. Meeting him at a whist party just after, he
complained that I had written in English, and he had been
obliged to hunt Canéa for three days in order to find some
person in confidence who could translate it for him, to
which I replied that after four days' search for a person
whom I could admit into the secrets of the consulate, I
had been finally obliged to have recourse to the public in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>terpreter.
He thereupon promised to write in French, and
in this language the diplomatic broil went on. The beginning
of the row had been an exchange of words between
the patrol and the offending protégé. Whose the fault of
the first word was an open question, but one with which
mine had nothing to do, as no provocation justified infringement
of the consular privilege of exterritoriality.
The zapties were put on trial. I had four witnesses, who
deposed that they saw them in the house. The four zapties
swore that they had not entered the doors, and the
Pasha declined to render judgment against them, saying
that, as there were four witnesses for and an equal number
against, the truth could not be ascertained. I demanded
that the testimony should be taken down for transmission
to Constantinople, whither I intended to appeal. By this
time the affair occupied the whole attention of the population
of Canéa, a large majority being on my side, and the
declaration of my intention to refer the affair to Constantinople
annoyed the Pasha very much, as he saw that he would
be compelled to make excuses. He, ingeniously, in taking
the testimony of my witnesses, omitted administering the
oath, while he administered it to his own. When, therefore,
the certified copy of the proceedings was delivered me, I
called in the parish priest, and took the evidence anew under
oath, affixed it to the record, and sent it all on. This was
having a trump too many for him, as he had intended to invalidate
the evidence of my witnesses on the ground that
they had refused to take the oath.</p>

<p>Judgment was delivered in Constantinople, ordering the
apology to be made for violation of domicile, and the minister
on my part engaged my protégé to make a declaration
that he had not had any intention of insulting the authori<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>ties.
But, with this positive order communicated to both
of us, he denied for several weeks that he had had any
orders on the subject; but as I stuck to the affair like a leech,
having nothing else to absorb my energies, he finally admitted
judgment, and ordered the mulazim to ask my pardon,
but cunningly managed to have the amends made in his own
audience-room to escape <i lang="fr">éclat</i>. I said nothing, but waited
until he made me a visit, and without any warning introduced
my culprit; and before he knew what was passing,
the Roland was delivered for his Oliver. He did not attempt
to conceal his annoyance, nor I my satisfaction, for
he had notified me that he expected our apology <i lang="fr">chez lui</i>.
This was not the end of the Lilliputian diplomatics, for on
my next visit to him the Pasha insisted on presenting me
with an intaglio, which, he said, he had bought of a peasant
some days before. He knew that I was an amateur of
gems, and he was a collector, and had several very fine
ones. The intaglio was exquisite, but the genuineness
doubtful, and, when he insisted on forcing it on me in spite
of my repeated refusals, I accepted it, with the intention of
sending it to the government if genuine, so as not to be
under obligations to him. Reaching home, I drew a file
across it, and found it to be a paste copy worth a dime. I
immediately wrote him a note, enclosing the file, and telling
him that, as he was a buyer of gems, and might not know
how well they were counterfeited, I begged to enclose him
an instrument I had found very useful.</p>

<p>After this skirmish, the general result of which, enormously
magnified in popular report, was a mortifying defeat
to the Pasha, merely from the obstinacy with which he
had fought the question, we got into a chronic state of
pique, and my resolution to go to Omalo and Sphakia put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
him into a great irritation. He had no right to oppose my
going, but tried to make trouble, and began to talk about
intrigues, etc. However, the news coming down from the
mountains that the fair was to be turned into an Assembly
stopped me, for a Cretan imbroglio is something into which
no wise man will allow himself to be drawn voluntarily.
On the 12th of April, the Assembly began to gather at
Omalo, whence it moved to Boutzounaria, then to Nerokouro,
nearer to Canéa, where it remained until the gathering
was nearly complete, when it moved back to Boutzounaria.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapt.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">The real agitation began when the Assembly finally
adjourned to Boutzounaria, a tiny village at
the edge of the plain of Canéa. Three thousand
men were assembled on a little plateau overlooking
the plain, and about three miles from the city.
Here gushes out of the living rock the stream which supplies
the city with water, by an aqueduct which dates from the
Hellenic times. Metellus cut it when he laid siege to Cydonia,
and the Cretans in the war of Greek independence
repeated the offence, and though, in the latter case, the siege
was raised by a fleet and army coming to the assistance of
the Turks, the sufferings produced by cutting off the water
were very great.</p>

<p>From here the people had a safe retreat into their fastnesses
above, and had nothing to fear from the Turkish
forces. They came unarmed, but kept patrols at night on
all the roads leading from the city to guard against surprise.
By day they could observe the whole plain from Suda to
Platania; and here, looking down on the orange groves of
Murnies and Perivoglia, the wide expanse of olive orchards,
and the fields where thousands of sheep, the property of
Mussulmans mainly, feed while the herbage is green with
the spring rains, they passed the time much after the old
Greek fashion, games of agility and strength occupying the
time of the young, while the old discussed the affairs of
state; but no disorder occurred during the session of the
Assembly proper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Sheep were roasted whole, the messengers came and
went, deputations from the further districts came in slowly,
others whose affairs demanded their presence at home went
away, there being none of those professed politicians who
live by attending conventions, and making the public harm
their good, so that there could be no vicarious expression
of opinion.</p>

<p>Finally, all was done, the <i lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> of democracy had
said its say, and signed its name for the indignant regards
of the most despotic of sovereigns. A solemn deputation
of gray-headed captains of villages, the executive committee,
brought to each of the consuls a copy of the petition,
and consigned the original to the Governor for transmission
to Constantinople. This functionary had been growing uneasy
about the apparent unanimity and deliberateness of the
Assembly, and, having cast his lead occasionally and found
the water deeper than he thought, began to be anxious to
see the Assembly dispersed. The moral force of the recognition
by the consular corps of the peaceful and legal
character of the meeting had dissuaded him from interrupting
its labors; but, the petition once delivered, he peremptorily
ordered the Cretans to go home and wait the answer,
intending to repeat the trick he had so successfully tried
before, namely, arresting the chiefs and calling a counter-assembly;
and, further ordering the committee to disperse, it
refused.</p>

<p>This was the position into which the Pasha had desired
to draw the Cretans. Their Assembly was perfectly legal,
they having a firman which permitted them to meet unarmed,
the Porte having long before seen the impolicy of
depriving them of a custom which was of so great antiquity
and reverence; but the Pasha hoped to give an illegal color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to their refusal to obey his order, and, according to his habit
of making his will the supreme law, determined to make
use of their persistence in their rights to precipitate the
collision which he knew they were unprepared for; and,
having once excited armed resistance, even against an
illegal use of authority, he confidently counted on the support
not only of his own government, but of the consuls.
To this end, he called a conference of the consular corps,
at which, having stated the measures he had taken, he
declared his intention to use the military force at his disposal
to disperse the Assembly. In this conference, a
division was shown as to the advisability of using force.
The French consul (a Levantine<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> of the lowest order,
a bastard of one of the De Lesseps family by a Jewish
adventuress, and an intense hater of the Greeks ever since
the society of Syra, where he was once <i lang="fr">Chancelier de Consulat</i>,
refused to recognize his mistress, a retired saltimbanque
from a café chantant of the Champs Elysées) supported
the Pasha in everything, and even urged him to
greater arbitrariness. The English consul, Mr. Dickson, a
man of the most humane character and entire honesty, had
an unfortunate weakness before constituted authorities, and
the greatest possible respect for the Turks, coupled with an
Englishman's innate dislike for a Greek. He had his
orders, moreover, to co-operate with his French colleague,
and, with his good faith and unsuspecting nature, he was
no match for his intriguing and mendacious yoke-fellow,
who led him wherever he wished. It was like coupling a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
faithful mastiff to a dirty bazaar dog. These two supported
the Pasha from very different motives, but with the same
result. All the others opposed any violence as inexpedient
and unjustifiable, being entirely assured of the peaceful intentions
of the committee. Ismael opened the discussion
by rehearsing his labors with the Assembly to induce them
to submit and disperse, and declared that, having exhausted
persuasion, he should employ force if the committee did
not at once dissolve. Mr. Dickson said that his Excellency
deserved great credit for his moderation, and hoped that
he would continue to show the same quality, adding that
thus far the Assembly had behaved in a strictly legal manner,
being convoked in accordance with their privileges,
but admitted that, if they refused to disperse on order, they
rendered themselves amenable to force. M. Derché, the
French consul, urged their immediate violent dispersal, but
the others all declared their opinion that, the Assembly
having met for a legal purpose, and having so far comported
themselves in an entirely unoffensive manner and
showed no intention of going beyond the object for which
they had met, the Pasha had no pretext for the employment
of force. Mr. Colucci, the Italian consul, then stated
that he had received information that the committee had
expressed their willingness to disperse on receiving the assurance
that the signers of the petition should not be persecuted
by the Pasha, and that he considered that the Governor
owed this assurance, since he and all others admitted that the
Assembly and committee had so far committed no illegal
act. His Excellency dodged the suggestion, and, rising,
was about to dismiss the conference, when, seeing that all
was on the point of being won to the arbitrary course of
the Pasha, I begged to offer my protest against any implied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
endorsement on my part of the proposed violence, as, until
the assurance of immunity had been given the Cretans, the
peaceful expedients for assuring tranquillity had not been
exhausted, or need for employment of force arisen. The
Italian, Russian, and other consuls followed me in protest.
The Pasha, disconcerted, sat down again, and the discussion
was renewed. His Excellency hesitated, but Derché came
to his relief with reasons for his not according the immunity
asked, saying that the Pasha had no right to compromise
the intentions of his government. I replied that there was
no question of Constantinople in the matter. The Cretans
had confidence in the good-will of the Sultan, but not in
his Excellency. Mr. Dickson was of opinion that the
assurance was already implied in the Pasha's promise to
support the petition with the Porte, and that, as the Assembly
had committed no act to deserve persecution, it could
not be supposed that they would be subjected to it. He
therefore regarded the assurance as uncalled for. Six consuls
were against the Pasha, and two with him, but he took
M. Derché's clue, and stood firm on the ground which
that led him to, and so the conference ended.</p>

<p>The Pasha had, however, failed in getting the moral
support of the consular corps to the blow which he had
intended to strike, and dared not send the troops out. He
made a great blunder in calling the conference, as the consuls
had no right of intervention in the affair, but, like all
over-cunning people, he caught himself in the trap he set
for us. Having invited us not really to get our opinion,
though he asked it, but to get our endorsement to his
policy, he not only failed in this, but got a rebuff which
made the experiment more hazardous than if he had said
nothing. It had another bad effect for him in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
public the difference between his Excellency and the consular
corps, and, as the latter is believed in Turkish countries
to be omnipotent, the popular feeling was immensely
strengthened.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> The irritation of the Pasha against the
consular corps was unbounded, especially against Colucci
and myself; indeed, I may say, peculiarly against myself
as an old enemy and the spokesman of the opposition.</p>

<p>Popular rumor magnified the difference, and myths as
wild as those of the day of Minos made the tour of the
island; one which I saw in a Greek newspaper represented
me as rising in the conference and declaring that, if the
Pasha sent troops against the committee, I would go and
put myself in front of them, and then we should see if the
troops dared fire!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all the friendly consuls united in urging the
dissolution of the committee, and leaving the protection
of individuals to the governments of the protecting powers,
as the only means of averting what was seen to be a
disastrous affair for the Cretans. That this was the true
policy events have shown. The Cretans were not prepared
to fight at that time, their friends on the Continent were
no more prepared to assist them, and there was no supply
of powder or arms in the island, nothing but old tufeks,
trophies of the war of 1821-30; the whole Turkish
empire was at peace, and its available force ready to be
poured on the island. The committee wavered and half-decided
to disperse, they offered to put themselves as a
committee into the hands of the Pasha, and await in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
palace, or other quarters assigned them, the reply to the
petition. This was refused, and the critical question hung
by a hair. The influence of two persons prevailed over the
committee against that of the consuls&mdash;one a priest called
Parthenius Kelaïdes, there being two Parthenii in the committee;
the other a Greek physician, temporarily in the
island, known by the two names of Joannides and Pappadakis,
long resident in England, an ultra-radical, and one
of those who, ultra-demagogical in all their tendencies, are
really honest in their intentions, and, wishing to do good,
only succeed in doing the greater evil. In Crete, Dr.
Joannides is generally considered as the immediate cause
of the disastrous turn events took, and, as soon as the
insurrection took active form, he abandoned it to its
manifest destiny, and has never been heard of since in the
island. It has always been a question if the Russian consul
was sincere in his union with his colleagues of the
majority, it being thought by some that in his hostility,
mainly personal, to the French consul, he secretly took
ground against the unconditional submission, that the
Pasha and M. Derché might not carry the day. Be this
as it may, I am confident that with regard to fighting he
was in accord with his colleagues, and considered that
actual insurrection should be avoided, and that the instructions
of the government were to this effect. But he was
a man of very unsound judgment, and so passionate and
personal in his way of seeing men and matters that I have
always been of the opinion that, from mere personal feeling
against Derché, he secretly strengthened Parthenius, over
whom his influence was supreme, in his obstinacy, and
so prevented the dispersal of the committee, which finally
withdrew to the mountains to be secure from a <i lang="fr">coup de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
main</i>. Before doing so, however, they offered to allow two
or more battalions of troops to guard them at Boutzounaria,
a proposition which the Pasha refused peremptorily,
knowing that, so long as the committee remained a constituted
body, the Cretans would respect its authority,
but that, if they dissolved and dispersed, they would lose
all right to act, or control over the people. So ingrained
is the Cretan's regard for the law of his ancient tradition
that, while the whole population would have risen at
once at the call of the committee as long as it was constituted,
not one of the districts would have regarded
an appeal made by the individual members when they
had ceased to represent in due form the original Assembly.
The question at issue was not, then, a trivial one, and in
the reply to it lay the decision of peace or war.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Unable to provoke a direct collision with the
committee, the Pasha had recourse to another
expedient: he called in the entire Mussulman
population of the island to the walled cities. Totally unprepared
for this unnecessary step, the unfortunate Mohammedans
broke up their establishments of all kinds, and repaired
to the fortresses in a state of the greatest irritation
at the sacrifice they had made and the privations they had
had to endure.</p>

<p>One complained that he had left his harvest uncut, and
another had left his after it had been garnered; one told
how he had been obliged, at a ruinous sacrifice, to dissolve
partnership with a Christian neighbor with whom he had
been engaged in silk-growing, the chief industry of the
island, the Christian having no money to pay him for his
share; and another had thrown all his silk-worms to the
fowls. The consuls, on becoming aware of this movement,
protested to the Pasha against a step so likely to produce
collisions between the two religions; on which the Pasha
sent counter-orders to his co-religionists to remain at home.
The bearers of these orders met the Mussulmans on the
roads, and succeeded in halting several bodies of them,
while others, without provisions or protection from the
weather, insisted on entering the cities. This confusion
and vacillation increased the suffering and irritation of the
people, and finally brought about the effect desired by the
Pasha&mdash;a feeling of hostility against the Christians. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
large body of these refugees encamped before the gates of
Canéa, and menaced the Pasha with insurrection if they
were not permitted to enter. The Pasha yielded, threw
open the gates, and again sent secret messengers to invite
the fugitives <i lang="fr">en route</i> to come into the city.</p>

<p>Candia, Canéa, and Retimo were speedily filled to overflowing
by an exasperated mob of fanatics, whose menaces
against the Christian population were neither measured nor
secret. The Christians remembered past insurrections, and
most of them had been witnesses of the scenes of 1858,
when the armed Mussulmans had dragged the body of a
Christian they had killed through the streets of Canéa, and
before the consulates, firing their pistols at the doors of the
most obnoxious, and were only prevented from wholesale
massacre by European men-of-war in the port. The entry
of the Mohammedans was the signal for a panic with the
Christians, and a frantic exodus commenced. The Lloyd
steamers were overcrowded every trip; several Greek
steamers came over, and caïques, and sailing-boats even,
were freighted full, and sailed for Milos, Cerigotto, and
other islands. In Candia, unrestrained by the presence
of European representatives, the Mussulmans entered the
houses of the Christians by force, and obliged the latter to
make room for them; the same took place in Retimo;
while in Selinos the whole Christian population took to the
mountains. Meanwhile, the Pasha had informed his government
that insurrection was imminent, and demanded
reinforcements of troops. These, beginning to arrive, exhilarated
the Mussulman population, who now began to
prepare for hostilities, and their priests began openly to
preach a crusade against Christianity. A Dervish, who
arrived with a battalion in which he served as chaplain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
landed with a green banner, spread his carpet on the marina
in front of the custom-house, and, after his prayer,
began to preach the holy war and the extermination of
Christianity, declaring that "the cross must no longer stand,
but be put in the dust." The rabble of porters and boatmen,
mainly Arabs, Syrians, and other foreign Mussulmans,
and intensely fanatical, were roused to the highest
enthusiasm, and shouted "Amin! amin!" to his exhortations,
when he continued his itineracy of the city. Information
of the fact being brought to me, I took a witness of
the Dervish's conduct, and remonstrated at once with the
general-in-chief, Osman Pasha, who ordered the Dervish
on board a frigate and sent him to Candia, where was
no European to report his proceedings.</p>

<p>The emigration of Christians to Greece continued until
about 12,000 souls left the island, and at all points of contact
mutual irritation of Christian and Mohammedan increased.
The hostility of the Mussulmans to the consuls
who opposed the Pasha became especially virulent, and we
were openly and continually threatened with being the first
victims of the new crusade.</p>

<p>By this time it became evident to all in the island that
the Pasha was laboring to provoke a collision, and that M.
Derché was doing his best to assist him, but neither side
seemed inclined to take the first step in open hostilities&mdash;the
committee because they did not desire them, and the
Pasha because he desired to avoid the responsibility of
them. The first blood shed was of Christian by Christian,
and furnishes so good an illustration of Cretan manners
that it seems worth detailing. During the exchange of
words which had taken place between the Pasha and the
Assembly, a messenger of the former, a Cretan Christian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was insulted by one of the committee's people, spit on, and
bitterly reproached for his unpatriotic subserviency. His
son shortly after assassinated the insulter. Both were Sphakiotes,
a race with whom blood-vengeance is a religious
obligation. It was supposed that the assassination was instigated
by the Pasha as the means of bringing on hostilities;
and, when the relatives of the murdered man went to
execute justice on the murderer, they found the house fortified,
and after a short skirmish, during which a child of the
murderer was killed by a ball fired through the door, the
attacking party retired to wait a more convenient opportunity,
and the Pasha sent a battalion of troops to the locality
to protect the murderer's house, making no pretence whatever
of bringing him to judgment. The move very nearly
succeeded in bringing on hostilities, a captain of one of the
adjoining villages, with his men, going at once to drive out
the intruding Turks. The committee sent a body of picked
men to disarm the villagers, in which they succeeded by
stratagem, and so averted a collision.</p>

<p>Amongst the troops which arrived were 8,000 Egyptians,
and with them the general-in-chief of the Egyptian army,
Schahin Pasha, an accomplished diplomat and administrator
of the Eastern type, munificent in gifts and promises,
and magnificent in ceremonies and negotiations. He came
in pursuance of a grand plan, concocted at Constantinople
between the Marquis de Moustier, the Turkish and Egyptian
governments, which was to coax or hire the Cretan
chiefs into appealing to the Viceroy for protection, when,
on the application of the plébiscite, the island was to be
transferred to Egypt, on the payment by the Viceroy to the
Sultan of a certain consideration, said to be £400,000
down, and £80,000 per annum tribute. De Moustier was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to have received £100,000 as payment for his services in
managing the affair, and in due course of time, it was whispered,
the Bay of Suda, having been duly fortified by the
Egyptians and made a naval station, was to have been
transferred <i lang="la">tale quale</i> to France. Schahin, on arriving,
placed himself in relations with the French consul, and
under his advice concocted the plan of operations. It was
a fatal mistake, and led to the ruin of the whole intrigue.
Derché could comprehend but two kinds of men&mdash;those
who are bought and those who buy them. He himself
was of the former class; Schahin was a prince in the
latter. Derché's opinion of the Cretans was that any could
be bought or frightened into their project, and Schahin,
accepting Derché's estimate, bid munificently for the votes
of the Cretan chiefs, made presents to the churches,
startling professions of liberality towards the Christians,
and comported himself in the most approved style of
Eastern potentates towards the consuls and all other influential
personages.</p>

<p>Having prepared, as he supposed, a favorable reputation
with the Cretan committee-men, he set out for the Apokorona,
the rocky region which contains the passes to Sphakia,
where the committee had moved its headquarters. There
he commenced direct operations by distributing large sums
of money amongst the influential Cretans, who, nothing
loath, accepted the money, making no promises. At this
juncture, the Governor-General, getting wind of Schahin's
plans, insisted on attending him during his interviews with
the committee, and joined him in the Apokorona. He
had a plan of his own, with which that of Schahin militated,
and for which he had been for several years preparing.
This was, having prepared and precipitated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
insurrection, and crushed it, as he confidently anticipated
doing between bribery and force, to draw up a petition for
signature by the Cretans, praying that the island might be
made a principality, with Ismael as prince. He therefore
did all in his power to prevent an understanding between
Schahin and the committee. Many days passed thus in
intrigues and counter-intrigues, until Ismael was struck
down by a dangerous fever, and was brought back to
Canéa scarcely alive, leaving the field open to Schahin,
who thereupon made a rendezvous with the committee,
but, with Egyptian faith, arranged a battalion of troops so
as to catch them as they came to keep it. The wily mountaineers
detected the trap, and broke off all communications,
so that Schahin was obliged to return to Canéa,
having gained nothing, and cursing the Cretans as a hard-headed,
impracticable set of villains. He left, however,
4,000 troops at Vrysis, an important strategical point in
the Apokorona, menacing the approaches to Sphakia and
the headquarters of the committee, and holding the most
direct communication between the eastern and western
parts of the island.</p>

<p>Having learned the worthlessness of M. Derché as a
means of influencing the Cretans, he had begun to enquire
amongst the islanders whose influence would best be employed
to serve his purposes, and was referred to the Russian
consul and myself; I presume primarily to myself, from
the fact that all the new proposals and negotiations were
directed at me, and, after many idle compliments and some
magnificent entertainments, his Excellency condescended
to open his plans with apparent frankness to me, and
proposed to me in so many words to pay me any sum I
should name if I could bring to bear the influence neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>sary
to secure the success of the Egyptian scheme. I took
his propositions into consideration, and immediately communicated
them to our minister at Constantinople, by
whom they were, I believe, laid before Lord Lyons, who,
I presume, quashed the matter, as it never was heard of
more in the island.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the agitation in the island, and the hostility
between the Mussulman and Christian population, were
rapidly increasing. One of the principal Cretan Mohammedans,
notorious for his activity and cruelty in the war of
1821-30, and who served the troops at Vrysis as guide and
interpreter, was killed under the following circumstances:
Having entered a café in one of the Christian villages near
Vrysis, he was boastingly narrating his former feats,
amongst which was the murder of a white Christian family
of eleven persons, whom he found at supper in their own
house unarmed, and, after having been welcomed by them,
he closed the doors, and killed the whole on the spot. He
continued boasting of what he would do in the coming
war in the same vein, and on leaving the café was waylaid
by a relative of the murdered family, and shot dead.</p>

<p>This was the first Mussulman blood, and the body was
carried with great pomp to Canéa, and lay in state outside
the gates, the remonstrances of the consuls preventing it
from being carried through the city according to the intention
of the relatives. The family of the new victim being
large and influential, it gathered in numbers outside the
gate, blocking it up temporarily, while the women of the
connection went <i lang="fr">en masse</i> to the palace of the Pasha to
demand vengeance on the murderers. The Mussulman
population became intensely exasperated, and proposed
retaliating on the Christians in general, beginning with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
consuls. The whole consular body united in pressure on
the Pasha to induce him to repress the agitation, and succeeded
so far that no immediate outbreak occurred. The
body was buried without worse demonstrations than insults
and menaces to all Christians, whoever and wherever,
and the crowd dispersed by order of the Pasha.</p>

<p>But though no actual violence occurred, the state of
excitement was intense, and it became evident that, in
spite of all the influence of the consular body, the least
untoward incident might precipitate a general massacre of
the Christians in the cities. The exodus by sea continued,
and the houses of the Russian, Italian, and Swedish consuls,
and my own, at Khalepa, were besieged by terror-stricken
crowds of Christians without the means of emigrating
to Greece, and bringing their household goods to
be stored under the protection of the flags. In the Italian
consulate alone were over 150, and several cabins clustered
round my door were filled with women and children,
while hundreds more, abandoning everything, took to the
mountains.</p>

<p>The Mussulmans were anxious for the fighting to begin.
The Governor had distributed rifles and ammunition <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>
to his Cretan co-religionaries. The Russian and Italian
consuls and myself urged at Constantinople concessions and
the removal of the Governor, and all except the English
and French begged for the despatch of a man-of-war for
the protection of European residents. M. Derché and Mr.
Dickson, considering that the presence of any European
flag would be an encouragement to the insurrection, refused
to unite in this request.</p>

<p>Several times the gates of the city had been closed to
prevent a sortie of the Mussulmans in the city to attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the consulates. We doubled the number of our cavasses,
got revolvers and rifles in order, prepared mattresses for
barricading the houses, and organized a strong patrol
from the Cretans who had taken refuge in the consulates,
to watch the roads by which the Turks would come from
Canéa.</p>

<p>At this juncture news arrived of the appointment of the
former Governor-General of the island, Mustapha Kiritli
Pasha, to supersede Ismael. The Imperial Commissioner,
for this was the title by which he was to be known, had
great personal influence over the Cretans of both religions,
and, if he had come immediately on his appointment, would
probably have succeeded in averting the insurrection. I
find in my correspondence of this date, August 28, 1866:
"As to the insurrection itself, it waits to draw first blood.
The Greeks to the number of thirty to thirty-five thousand
[an enormously exaggerated estimate, I afterward found]
are concentrated in the mountains, and determined to fight
it out to the bitter end. The delays of diplomacy to right
a wrong that was too patent even for your [English] consul
to blind himself to, have permitted a trouble to grow that
might have been rooted up with reasonable concessions on
the part of the government, and now nothing but death
and desolation will bring back Crete to Turkish rule. They
will now insist on independence where they only demanded
common justice. We shall doubtless have another sanguinary,
desperate struggle, and a depopulated island, unless
Europe intervenes to right the wrong it did in 1830."</p>

<p>The troops in the Apokorona were face to face with the
Cretans armed to protect the committee, and that step forward
would make a collision certain. The irregulars, proud
of their new rifles, were firing in every direction all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the country. One heard rifle-balls whistling past, falling
on the roofs and everywhere continually. Still no European
ships. By every post we pleaded with our ministers
at Constantinople for protection. The anxiety and excitement
became almost unendurable. The whole community
seemed to be in a state of tension and apprehension that
approached madness. I found myself going continually and
unconsciously to my balcony, telescope in hand, although
ten minutes before I failed to discover an object in the
range of vision. I grew, like the genius of the Arabian
tale in his vase of lead, ready to curse the tardy deliverer
that he tarried so long. The sight of a steamer on the horizon
produced a loathing, as one after another we had
watched them approach only to see the accursed crescent
increase on our vision. One night a party of Mussulmans,
passing through the suburb in which we resided, in frolic
fired several pistol-shots, yelling "Death to the Christians!"
In a few minutes, all that remained of Christianity in the
quarter outside the gates of the consulates were rushing in
a state of uncontrollable panic to beg admission. My cavasses
were obdurate and indifferent, being Mussulmans,
and refused to open, and, while I lay listening for indications
of further and serious disturbance, my wife had descended,
thrown the doors open, admitting the crowd of
women and children, who passed the rest of the night seated
on the floor of the consulate. None of us left our walls
needlessly, and then only with an armed guard. My
children for weeks did not pass the threshold, and, when
business called either of us, whom the Cretans called the
friendly consuls, to the palace of the Governor-General, we
were greeted passing through the streets with unmistakable
scowls and menaces. The sentinel at the city-gate as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
passed one day, instead of presenting arms, as etiquette requires
to a consular officer, saluted me as an infidel dog,
accompanying the epithet with a menace and grimace
comprehensible even to one who understood not a word
of Turkish. I begged my wife at last to take the children
and go to Syra, where they would be in security, but she
resolutely refused, believing that her departure would be
the signal for the last panic among the Christian women,
who depended on our protection. Only they who know
the extent and bitterness of Mussulman fanaticism can
estimate the danger or anxiety of those few weeks.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapt.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">The first relief was the flying visit of Admiral
Lord Clarence Paget, in the <em>Psyche</em> despatch-boat,
direct from Constantinople <i lang="fr">en route</i> for
Malta, to inform us that the <em>Arethusa</em> had been ordered
to Crete. This was a reprieve of a few days,
and was followed by complete freedom from anxiety
on the arrival of the <em>Arethusa</em>, the sound of whose
saluting guns at Suda Bay (the port of Canéa for large
ships) produced an emotion which was like waking from a
long nightmare. We all went to Suda to pay our official
and personal visits, which the officers returned, and bluejackets
swarming in the town, and racing over the plain of
Canéa like mad fox-hunters, hilarious, indifferent to yataghan
or bullet, as if they were anything but Giaours, assured
both Turk and Christian that at least the Europeans must
be respected. We took down our barricades, and again
moved about freely; yet the feeling was so strong amongst
the Mussulmans that the English were on their side that
the native Christians experienced no benefit from the cause
which brought us comparative relief. We attended service
the Sunday subsequent to the arrival of the <em>Arethusa</em>
on board, and, lunching with Captain McDonald, were called
from the table to see the stars and stripes rounding the
point and entering the bay. They floated from the gaff
of the corvette <em>Ticonderoga</em>, whose commandant, being at
Trieste, came for old friendship's sake to look after us on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
getting the first news of the insurrection. Her stay for a
few days was a demonstration of force which, so far as I
was concerned, left a most healthy impression as to my
being supported by the United States Government, the more
that the <em>Ticonderoga</em> sailed from Suda direct for Constantinople
(according to her commander's original intention),
a course which produced a general impression in Crete
that she had gone to support my view on the question.
Nothing could exceed in friendliness and cordiality the
manner in which the commander, Commodore Steedman,
and his officers supported me in my difficult position, and
identified the national dignity with the respect due to the
humblest of its representatives. The <em>Arethusa</em>, a few days
after her arrival, was succeeded by H. B. M.'s gunboat
<em>Wizard</em>, which during several subsequent months was our
only and sufficient protector. Her humane and gallant
young commander, Murray, will ever be remembered with
gratitude and honor by every European resident in Crete
during the insurrection. He placed us all under obligations
of many kinds which a passing notice can only faintly recognize.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dissension between the Governor-General
and the Egyptian Pasha increased in violence, until anything
like co-operation became impossible, the policy of
the latter being clearly pacific with a show of force. He
wished to avoid a collision as long as possible, hoping
still to conciliate Cretan public opinion, while Ismael was
determined to do everything in his power to bring about
hostilities. The Egyptian therefore threw himself for support
on the consular body, from whom he received that
degree of support which their instructions and personal
sympathies rendered possible, as, with the exception of M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Derché, all the members of the corps were anxious to prevent
bloodshed.</p>

<p>The committee sent to the Italian and Russian consuls
and myself urgent entreaties that we would persuade the
Egyptians to withdraw from Vrysis, a position which provoked
attack by the Cretans, as, if maintained by the troops,
it prevented all strategical movements by the insurrectionary
forces. This request we all urged on the attention of
Schahin, and he energetically demanded from the Governor-General
permission to withdraw the menaced battalions.
The effective reply of the Governor was to withdraw all
the Turkish supports, and leave Schahin to his own resources,
compelling him to devote two of his four battalions
remaining to keeping open the communications of
Vrysis with the sea-shore. While this family quarrel paralyzed
the government at Canéa, the Mussulmans in Selinos,
a fortress on the south side of the island, were shut in by
strong guards of Christians posted on the hills round about,
and were even more impatient than at Canéa because more
inconvenienced, and finally made a sortie on one of the
adjoining Christian villages. They were fruitlessly warned
back, and, persisting, were fired upon, and several killed
and wounded. Ismael immediately called a council of
war, and made a requisition on Schahin for a battalion of
Egyptians to go with another of Turks to the relief of the
Seliniotes. Schahin sent for me at once to advise him on
the matter. I recommended him strongly not to obey the
requisition, as the breach of the peace having taken place
between the indigenes of the two religions justified him
in assuming that hostilities did not exist, and, according to
his instructions, that he was under no circumstances to be
drawn into an offensive movement. He therefore return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ed
answer that, his battalions at Vrysis being menaced,
and this affair being only a collision between Cretans of
the two religions, he was not justified in withdrawing any
of his remaining troops from a position where they might
be needed to secure the safety of those already compromised,
and declined to obey the requisition. The expedition
was therefore abandoned, though the steamers were
lying in the roadstead with steam up ready to transport
the troops. At the same time, news arrived from Vrysis
that the Cretans had concentrated at the passes, and forbade
the sending of any more supplies to the Egyptian camp,
under penalty of attack. This produced another request
from Schahin to the Russian consul and myself to urge
the committee to take no such offensive step, he promising
at the same time not to make common cause with the
Turkish troops, even should they be attacked, so long as
the Egyptian troops were not molested in any way.</p>

<p>On the heels of this came news of another sortie from
Selinos of the Mussulmans, which had been repulsed, as
well as another of the regular troops made in support of
them. The receipt of this news brought excitement in
Canéa to its culmination, and irritation toward the insurgents
(for such they had substantially become) began to
find expression in acts of violence to unoffending Christians
in and about the city. A Christian who kept horses
for hire at the gates of the city, was attacked and beaten
and stabbed to death; immediately after, another, in the
city, met the same fate; and the authorities taking no notice
whatever of these murders, the fanatics, emboldened and
having tasted blood, murdered, pillaged, and robbed in
every direction.</p>

<p>The panic which ensued amongst the few remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Christians was indescribable. Many started on foot, alone
or in small parties, for the mountains, but, having been entirely
disarmed, most of them were cut off and murdered
on the way. Others, coming to the city in ignorance of
these events, were met and shot down on the roads. No
one was allowed to carry arms to defend himself, nor was
any investigation made into these matters. The state of
the country for the next few days defies description.
Gunshots were heard in every direction, and the more
friendly of the Mussulman peasantry brought news of
single bodies here, and groups there, by the roadside, in
houses, and in chapels, where they had taken refuge. No
one dared go out to investigate the truth of most of these
reports, but the secretary of the Greek consul made an
excursion, accompanied by several cavasses, as far as Galatas,
a village of the plain, three miles from Canéa, and
counted seven dead bodies naked by the way. By the
sea-side, between my house and the city, were the slaughter-houses
where all the cattle and sheep for the use of
the city and army were butchered. Here were ordinarily
immense flocks of ravens, accustomed to batten without
disturbance on the offal thrown out on the shore. Within
two or three days the whole of those birds deserted the
shore, where they did not reappear for weeks, but were to
be seen in small flocks hovering amongst the olive-groves
of the plain.</p>

<p>During this state of things, extreme hostilities broke out
at several points of the island. The messengers we had sent
to the committee to urge a truce with the Egyptians had
not been permitted to pass the lines, or for some other
reason failed in reaching their destination, so that our message
was never received by the committee, who, in pursu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>ance
of their previous resolution, summoned the Egyptians
peremptorily to leave the Apokorona or take the consequences,
and, the refusal being equally peremptory, the
committee ordered their forces to close at once upon the
troops, cut off access to the springs, and close the passage
to all relief. The unfortunate Egyptians, disastrously repulsed
in an attempt to recover the springs of water from
which they had their daily supply, were driven within their
entrenched camp and closely blockaded. The battalions
ordered to reopen the communications, being also repulsed
in their attack in the passes, and those in camp having exhausted
all their ammunition, food, and water, were compelled
to surrender at discretion. The Cretans permitted
them to march out with their arms and all of their equipments
they could carry, and gave them forty-eight hours
to send mules without escort to carry off the remainder.
No parole even was exacted not to bear arms in future.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with this affair, the Turkish troops at
Selinos, having made a sortie in force on the Christians
who beleaguered them, were drawn into the defiles of the
mountains, and were then attacked, beaten, and driven
into the mountain fortress of Candanos, where they were
blockaded closely. These feats of arms naturally elated
the Cretans, and exasperated the Turks correspondingly.
The Governor-General lost all self-possession, and abandoned
the reins of government to his subordinates. Confusion
became anarchy, and, to increase the dismay, the few remaining
Christians in the cities were forbidden to leave
the island. The Egyptians, mortified by their defeat, assailed
the Christians in the villages nearest their new encampment
in the most brutal and barbarous manner.</p>

<p>The presence of the <em>Wizard</em> in the port alone prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
a general massacre of the Christians in Canéa. Assemblies
of the Mussulman Cretans were held in their quarter
of the city, with the avowed purpose of going out to
kill the Christians in the suburbs, beginning with the consuls.
The military authorities had the presence of mind
to close the gates to all Christians entering or Mussulmans
leaving the town. The whole Christian population of the
island seemed in arms, and considerable parties of them
made raids within sight of the walls of the city, carrying
off as prisoners a number of Mussulmans who were engaged
in getting in the vintage.</p>

<p>At the moment when it seemed impossible that confusion
should not end in universal anarchy and massacre,
the Imperial Commissioner arrived. Mustapha Kiritli Pasha
had, by an impartial and energetic, if barbarous, administration
of the affairs of the island, secured the respect and
even esteem of the Christians, while his merciless repression
of previous insurrections had inspired the strongest
belief in his military capacity. As he entered the town, a
Christian was shot down in the road behind him, one of
the few who, influenced by the old regard for the Pasha,
ventured to follow in his train; and, at the same moment,
another was stabbed to death within a few hundred yards&mdash;a
well-known employee of one of the principal Turkish beys,
whose position had hitherto been his protection. The installation
of Mustapha checked these disorders, and, investigation
being ordered into them, the Governor-General, whose incapacity
and malevolence became apparent, was peremptorily
ordered to leave for Constantinople, not even being allowed
time to pack his household furniture. The Commissioner at
once commenced organizing and preparing expeditions to
attack the Christians and relieve the troops cooped up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Candanos. The Cretan Mohammedans, to the number of
5,000, were regularly enrolled as volunteers. Strict orders
were given in every direction for the protection of unarmed
individuals, and in all the villages within the power of the
government forces the option was given to the inhabitants
of inscribing themselves as friends of the government and
taking written protection&mdash;a course which would expose
them to the hostility of the insurgent forces&mdash;or of joining
their co-religionists in the mountains. A proclamation was
issued, directed to the committee, in which the insurgents
were summoned instantly to submit and give up their arms.
No concessions were made, none even promised; the
purport of the firman was, "Submit, be good children, and
you shall see what you shall see!" As was to be expected,
the committee, flushed by its recent successes and encouraged
by the promise of succor from Greece, where committees
had been formed at the first news of hostilities
having commenced, rejected the proclamation contemptuously,
and issued a counter-proclamation, which was
forwarded to all the consuls and to the ministers at Constantinople.</p>

<p>As I shall have, in the course of this history, to make
serious question of the conduct of the Greek government,
I shall do it the justice to say that, to the best of my
information, it had up to this time utterly discouraged the
insurrection as injudicious and ill-timed. But the affair of
Vrysis had so great an effect on public opinion in Greece
that the government was obliged to make concessions to it.</p>

<p>Mustapha found the Egyptian army diminished and
utterly demoralized by defeat. About 12,000 Turkish troops
were in the island, indifferently equipped and in a poor
state of discipline; added to these, he had his 5,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
irregulars and a few hundred Albanians. From these he
organized an army of about 10,000 men, with whom he
marched to the relief of Candanos. The direct passes were
all held by the Cretans in such strength that the Turks were
unable to force their way, and they were obliged, therefore,
to make a long détour through the western part of
the island, constantly harassed by parties of the insurgents,
who held all the advantageous positions on the route.</p>

<p>The expedition succeeded in relieving Candanos without
a fight, the Cretans retiring before the overpowering forces
of the Commissioner, not too soon for the besieged, who
were at the verge of starvation before relief arrived. The
siege was marked by the usual atrocities of those religious
barbarian conflicts. An incident, related to me by a Christian
Cretan who assisted at the siege, will suffice to show
the animus by which they were already possessed. Some
of the besieged Cretans, recognizing a brother of a prisoner
in their possession amongst the besiegers, killed the prisoner,
and, cutting him up as the butchers cut meat, hung
the members above the parapet, calling to the besiegers
that they had meat yet. The besiegers retaliated by treating
half-a-dozen prisoners in the same way, and calling to
the besiegers that, if they wanted more, they might come
and get it.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>The Commissioner withdrew immediately, taking in his
escort all the Mussulman families who had been blockaded
in Selinos and Candanos, together with those of some neighboring
villages who had not hitherto been molested by the
Christians, the insurrectionary committee having still hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of conciliating the opposition of their Mussulman compatriots,
and, in pursuance of this policy, having given
orders to do everything possible to induce the Mussulmans
to make common cause with the Christians. These, however,
augmented the train of the Commissioner with their
families and flocks, and the return of the army so encumbered
was slow and dangerous, the Christians following
and harassing the flanks, showing resistance in front at all
difficult passes, and cutting off stragglers; the troops, in
retaliation, destroying all villages on the road of return as
they had on that of going. I had been able to watch from
my balcony the departure of the troops, and follow their
line of march by the smoke of the burning villages; and
after two weeks' absence, during the latter part of which
no communications had been kept up between the army
and the capital, the wildest panic prevailing at headquarters,
where rumors were generally believed to the effect
that the whole army had been blockaded, I was able,
from the same point, to perceive the return of the troops
by the same ominous indications. In returning by a
shorter route than that followed in going, the army had
to pass by a difficult ravine, called Kakopetra, where the
Christians made a determined attack and attempt to block
the road, in which they would certainly have succeeded
had they possessed modern firearms, but as they were
armed mostly with the tufeks of their grandfathers, or
pistols of the war of Greek independence, an attack on
equal terms was impossible. The Pasha, by throwing out
his irregulars on both sides to keep back the insurgents,
and pressing down the road, with the imperial troops and
Egyptian regulars escorting the families and flocks,
succeeded in forcing his way through, though with serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
loss. A European surgeon attached to the government
hospital at Canéa assured me that the killed amounted to
120 and the wounded to upwards of 800, the wounds being
mostly slight from spent balls apparently fired from pistols.
In fact, if the Cretans had been well armed and provided
with good ammunition, the campaign would probably
have ended there and then, and Kakopetra become as
famous as Askypho in the great insurrection, when the
same Mustapha, in 1823, was blockaded, and his army
almost exterminated, himself, with his immediate followers,
only escaping by scattering the contents of the military
treasury on the road.</p>

<p>The successful return of the army to Canéa was the
signal of the most enthusiastic rejoicings on the part of the
Mussulman population of Canéa, who, with the extravagance
of a semi-barbaric people, had passed the last few
days in the wildest frenzy of fear and irritation.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">The rescue happily concluded, the Pasha organized
a movement against Lakus, Theriso, Keramia,
strong points where the Christians had assembled
in considerable numbers and from whence they
might harry the plains of Canéa, carrying off flocks
and occasionally prisoners. This expedition consisted
of twelve thousand men. While the organization was
going on, the Christians came down to the number of
several hundred, and took possession of the direct road
to Theriso, and attacked the block-house on the hill
of Malaxa overlooking the plain, and three miles from
Canéa. The attack on the block-house necessarily
failed from the want of artillery, and the Commissioner
succeeded in reinforcing the garrison strongly after a
sharp repulse in which the reinforcements were driven
back nearly to the plain country, as I myself was able to
perceive, watching the skirmish through a telescope. The
day after, two battalions were ordered to clear the road to
Theriso, held by the insurgents, and were assisted by a
battery of artillery, taking the Cretans in flank from the
block-house of Malaxa, firing across an impassable ravine.
The attack lasted the whole afternoon, and, watching
the affair through my glass, I could perceive that
neither the direct nor the flank movement produced the
least impression on the insurgents, who maintained their
position till nightfall, when the troops were withdrawn to
the plain. The next day the attack was renewed with
five thousand men and a considerable force of irregulars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
The Cretans fell back from their position of the day before
to the ridges and ravines which cut up the plateau of
Keramia, where they received the attack of the troops, and,
always retreating but contesting every inequality of ground,
they fell back to the precipitous spurs of the White or Sphakian
Mountains on the further side of the plain, where they
made good their position during the remainder of the day.
The losses on either side we were never able to ascertain,
though the Cretans admitted a loss of seven killed and thirty
or forty wounded, among the former being a son of Manosouyanaki,
the chief captain of the district, who commanded
the defence. The troops returned at night, having occupied
the whole day in making an advance of about three
miles, but the official report the next day declared that the
movement had been perfectly successful, without the loss
of a man killed or wounded. The expedition against Lakus,
proceeding westward, turned that position, which the
Cretans abandoned without contest, and retreated across
the almost impassable ravine which separates the hill of
Lakus from the central chain of mountains, to Zurba, a
village situated on a bold bastion, which could only be attacked
successfully from the higher mountains, and which
they had fortified in a rude manner as depot and hospital.
The number of Cretans at Zurba amounted to six hundred,
the attacking force as many thousand, with two batteries
of artillery; but after two days' bombardment, during
part of which time I counted (Zurba being only nine
miles in a straight line from my house) thirty shots per
minute, and three assaults, the Turks were obliged to abandon
the attack and move on to Theriso. This village, an
ancient stronghold of Crete, which, with the ravine leading
to it, has been the scene of many disasters to the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
troops in the different insurrections, is situated in a valley
surrounded on all sides but one by abrupt hills, and could
easily have been held by five hundred well-disciplined and
resolute men against the whole Turkish army. The Cretans
lacked not resolution, but unfortunately for their discipline
the news arrived at this moment that the Panhellenion
blockade-runner had landed her first cargo of arms
and supplies on the north side of the island, on learning
which nearly the whole force stationed for the protection
of Theriso went to assist in the debarkation of the cargo.
Mustapha took this moment for the attack on Theriso,
which he occupied without opposition, and evacuated with
equal celerity on receiving warning of the return of the
Cretans, armed with the rifles of the Greek national guard
and reinforced by a body of Hellenic volunteers. The Cretans,
following their usual policy, however, gathered on his
flanks and harassed his retreat, for it virtually became
such, until he reached the positions attained in the previous
attack by Keramia, where he encamped to reorganize the
movement onward through the Rhizo<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> against the Apokorona.</p>

<p>In a campaign of seven days, he had destroyed nearly
a score of villages, most of them undefended; had utterly
destroyed all hope of compromise or conciliation; and,
though he had penetrated the strongest outposts of the insurgents,
had attained no other result than the temporary
possession of the position of Lakus, the village being a
mass of ruins, as a base of operations in case of a new attack
on Theriso or an expedition against Omalo, amid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
western peaks of the White Mountains. He had anticipated
great moral effects from his mountain artillery, but the Cretans
learned to despise it. With their old-fashioned firearms,
they had managed to harass the Turkish troops to such
an extent that they looked to the days when they should
fight with rifles with enthusiasm and resolution. Then every
burned village left an additional number of men who,
having lost all their property, had no interest in peace; so
that every advantage he had gained had only increased
the force opposed to him. I urged this consideration as
strongly as possible on the Commissioner in several visits,
which was all the better reason in his mind to make him
insist on his policy. He had expected that his name
would induce immediate submission, or, at least, that in a
single battle he would make so decided an impression that
the favorable terms he was then prepared to offer would
be at once accepted, but, till the military power of the Cretans
was completely broken, the Porte was determined to
make no concessions of any kind. The insurgents, on the
other hand, were already under the influence of Hellenic enthusiasts,
and receiving munitions of all kinds by the blockade-runners,
and the drift of their counsels was toward war.
It was clear now that the Porte had made a most disastrous
blunder, in fact an unbroken series of blunders in all its measures.
It should not have entertained the project of transference
in the beginning; in the second place, having decided
on the transfer, it should have carried it out logically, and not
by a bastard popular vote enforced by the presence of an
Egyptian army; and finally, having decided to send the Commissioner,
it should have sent him at once, instead of keeping
him and the answer to the petition waiting for three
months. Its whole course was irritating and unjust. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
had no excuse for the employment of force, and was warned
by the consular corps, without exception, of the previous
dishonest, tyrannical, and impolitic conduct of Ismael
Pasha. If it had a consistent policy in the whole matter, it
could only have been to provoke an insurrection in Crete
when all the other provinces were unable to rise, and so
disarm by a crushing suppression the enemy most dreaded
of all its subject provinces.</p>

<p>The finale of the Theriso campaign was marked by the
appearance of the great <i lang="la">Deus ex machinâ</i> of the insurrection,
the Russian frigate <em>Grand Admiral</em>, and the commencement
of the real moral intervention of Russia in
the already complicated affair. The Russian commander,
Boutakoff, was too fit a selection for the rôle which events
compelled (or permitted) him to play to have been intentionally
chosen by any government. In the three years
subsequent to his arrival, I saw him often, and knew as
much of his opinions and feelings as it is permitted an
outsider to know of a Russian official, and both his
acts and language have always confirmed my impression
that the Russian Government did not influence the
turn events took, and anticipated only a speedy and
disastrous end to the insurrection, while entertaining the
most cordial sympathy and good wishes for a more prosperous
end than any sane man would have expected. In
fact, with the exception of the boldest of the insurgents
and some harebrained Greeks, no one in the island anticipated
anything but ruin from the movement. Captain
Boutakoff was a devout and liberal Christian, a type of all
that is most chivalric, patriotic, and compassionate in manhood,
large-brained, prudent, and, if zealous enough to
merit all the honors then and since conferred on him by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
sovereign, he was never capable of any patriotic vice
worse than the most profound reticence. To know him
as I knew him was to conceive a better opinion of his
country. I am morally certain that Boutakoff never said
or did anything to encourage in any way the hopes of the
Cretans, or lead them to indulge in dreams of European
intervention in their favor. His position was that of a
humane observer, and with all the sympathy which existed
between him and myself, and the mutual confidence in
our personal intercourse, I could find in his language and
acts no trace of <i lang="fr">arrière-pensée</i> in favor of any other interest
than the real good of the Cretans. My own strong
sympathy with the unhappy islanders made me the ally
and co-operator with whoever gave them any help, and
placed me, I have good reason to believe, high in the confidence
of the Russian authorities in Crete and Constantinople; and,
with no political interest in the matter other
than Cretan, I am free to confess that, while I believed
Russian policy in Crete to be the good of Crete, I was
willing to aid in carrying out any plans that policy might
point out. If, then, these plans had pointed out the secret
encouragement of the insurrection as desirable, I am certain
that I should have been influenced in that direction. It
will be seen before I have finished that I am no apologist
for the Russian conduct of this affair when it had become a
matter of European interest and action; but I must do the
Russian Government the justice to declare that it is in no
wise responsible for the disaster and carnage which the
war brought on, and that it was not until several months
that it openly gave the revolt moral encouragement (as a
means of weakening the Turkish empire?)</p>

<p>The Imperial Commissioner having concentrated and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>organized
his troops at Bondapoulo, a village of the plain
of Keramia, transferred his base of operations to Kalyves,
on the sea and at the mouth of the river which drains the
Apokorona, and as soon as the change was effected commenced
his march toward Krapi, the main pass of Sphakia.
The troops were first opposed at Stylos, the first of the
natural positions of which the country affords so many, and
were repulsed in a first attack. The vanguard were of
Egyptians, who were in this campaign systematically put
foremost and encouraged in every brutality and ferocity, in the
hope apparently of making them good troops, their natural
temper being unfavorable to that end. Though the result of
this treatment certainly did show that nobody is so brutal
and devilish as a coward, and the fellahs eminently distinguished
themselves in devastation and killing of defenceless
people, they never succeeded in exciting any other
feeling than hatred and contempt in the Cretan. At Stylos,
as in other places, they were beaten with ease, and it
was only on the following day, when the Cretan positions
were flanked and the irregulars sent forward, that the insurgents
evacuated their strong positions. In this affair
the Egyptian general, Ismael Pasha, urging his troops to
retrieve their disgrace at Vrysis, was mortally wounded.
The troops attacked the position of Campos, which was
abandoned by all combatants, the remaining inhabitants
being put to death, and the insurgents relinquished all the
country as far as Vafé to the Turks, who ravaged it in
the most thorough manner, with the extreme of barbarity
and atrocity to all the Christian inhabitants who were unfortunate
enough to fall into their hands. In the neighborhood
of Kephalá there are numerous grottoes, partly
natural and partly excavated, as places of refuge from im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>memorial
times, some of them celebrated in the traditions
of the island for the sieges they had maintained. Into these
many of the Christians retreated, taking with them their
effects. In one of these about two hundred villagers,
mostly old men, women, and children, had taken refuge,
and, refusing to surrender, were stifled in the cave.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> A
woman came, one day, to my house to obtain protection
and charity, having been brought a prisoner to
Canéa, and narrated to me the circumstances of her capture.
She was, she told me, on her way from her village
to a larger one in the Apokorona to purchase bread, and
was in the company of eleven men, all Christians and
unarmed, going with the same intention. They were
stopped in the road by a party of Seliniote irregulars, who
deliberately beheaded the men and piled their heads in
the path, taking her with them to headquarters to extort
from her information as to the places of concealment of
her compatriots. Giving no desired indications, she was
about to be beheaded, when two Egyptians whom she
had sheltered and fed after the defeat of Vrysis recognized
her, and, stating her kindness to the Pasha, she was
released and sent to Canéa.</p>

<p>The consequence of this severity was not what Mustapha
Pasha expected it to be, to intimidate the Cretans into
submission, but to drive them into the high mountains,
where hundreds perished from hunger and cold. As children
as well as adults of both sexes were welcome game
to the fanaticism called out by the first taste of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
blood, and no partial submission was accepted, the cruelty
being the means to an end quite characteristic of Turkish
policy and the nature of the Albanian, who years before
had earned the title of the "butcher of Crete"; and as the
submitted had no power to induce the submission of the
more resolute insurgents, there was no possible safety to
any portion of the population except in the mountains,
where a large proportion of the weakest died, leaving the
men unencumbered for vengeance. Every step of the
Turkish authorities was a blunder. Submission being useless
unless complete, and complete submission out of the
power of any one to enforce, there remained only complete
insurrection, and this the commissioner succeeded
in exciting, with a renewal of all the old religious animosity,
and a desperation natural to men to whom surrender
brought no protection, and submission no guarantee.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">No resistance was after this offered until Vafé was
reached. Here about two hundred Greek volunteers
and a thousand Cretans, under the
command of Hadji Mikhali, of Lakus, and Costa Veloudaki,
of Sphakia, were concentrated. The Cretan chiefs
were opposed to any regular fighting, and counselled
a retreat into the ravines, where they could entangle
the troops and attack them without serious risk to themselves,
while a pitched fight was not only not in the
way of the islanders, but, if lost, as they considered it must
be in view of the overpowering Turkish forces, it would
discourage the movement greatly. Zimbrakaki, the commander
of the volunteers, with the most of his men, wished
not to abandon so strong a position, at which they had,
moreover, constructed a strong redoubt, without fighting,
and it was decided to make a stand. The majority of
the Cretans, however, recognizing no authority but that
of their captains, withdrew before the fight, which, had
Mustapha been a commander careful of the lives of his
troops, might have been decided by flanking movements
without firing a shot, as his army was composed of ten
thousand regulars and fully three thousand irregulars, Albanian
and Cretan, while the Christians were hardly five
hundred. No forces the committee could have assembled
would have made the stand a prudent or justifiable one
under the circumstances, and its result was what the Cretan
chiefs had foreseen. Mustapha, as usual, opened with a
direct assault of Egyptians, which was repulsed with heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
loss; but, in the meantime, a body of Albanians were engaged
in climbing the heights which protected the flanks
of the position, and so nearly succeeded in surprising the
Greeks that they only saved themselves by precipitate flight.
A few gallant fellows, indifferent to the odds or the certainty
of defeat, were killed, taken prisoners, or escaped
by suicide. The committee, with the Hellenes, retreated
to Askyfó, and made the best preparations to defend the
ravine which their demoralized forces permitted; and so
formidable was the position that Mustapha decided not to
attack it, but to be content with the moral advantage of
the victory at Vafé, which was nearly fatal to the insurrection,
in spite of the triviality of the losses of the Christians,
which did not surpass thirty killed of both Hellenes and Cretans.
The latter had attributed invincibility to their allies,
and to find them defeated so utterly at the first encounter
paralyzed the insurrection for the moment; and, if the Turkish
commander had moved energetically on Askyfó, it is
not probable that any serious defence would have been
made, and, as there was then no other centre of resistance,
the taking of Askyfó would have left the movement without
any power of forming another nucleus of moral force. The
committee must have dispersed, and the thousands of families
assembled in Sphakia must have surrendered.</p>

<p>But Mustapha, remembering his former disaster in the
defile of Krapi, hesitated, waited at Prosnero and in the
Apokorona, while the Sphakiote chieftains craftily negotiated,
and made their calculations on the amount of assistance
they could get from Greece, the measure of concessions or
personal advantages they could hope for as the price of
submission, and prolonged the practical truce until the
reaction from the effects of the late defeat began. Hadji<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Mikhali, with his Lakiotes, went back to Lakus and Theriso,
entirely abandoned by the troops, and resumed his old
policy of little and incessant raids to harass the Turkish
commander and keep his own men from the despondency
of inaction.</p>

<p>The immediate salvation of the insurrection was, however,
the arrival of Col. Coroneos, the ablest by far of the
Greek chiefs, and the only one, it would seem, who was
capable of adapting his plans to the kind of material he had
to work with. He arrived too late either to prevent or
assist in the battle of Vafé, and, seeing the danger the insurrection
was in of dying of despondency and the dissidence
of its chiefs, moved at once into the central provinces,
and, collecting together such Cretans as he could
find, surprised and cut off two small Turkish detachments,
and with unimportant advantages reawakened the enthusiasm
of the fickle and excitable islanders, gained for himself
the prestige of victory, and rapidly recruited a considerable
force.</p>

<p>At the same time, slight advantages were won by Hadji
Mikhali near Canéa, and by other chiefs in the eastern provinces,
where an Ottoman detachment had been disastrously
repulsed in an attempt to penetrate into the Lasithri
district. Coroneos, with a small body of volunteers, established
his headquarters at the old fortified convent of Arkadi,
a building of Venetian construction of such size and
strength as to be a fit depot of supplies and place of refuge
as against anything less than a regular siege. From here
he harassed the detachments which issued from Retimo,
and kept alive the movement in the district between Sphakia
and Mount Ida, and on several occasions menaced the
city of Retimo, which is fortified by a low wall, almost un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>provided
with artillery. Mustapha, after nearly a month of
indecision and negotiation, in which the Cretans showed a
diplomatic ability and duplicity quite worthy the antique
reputation of the race, found himself compelled to act
against the new dangers which Coroneos had conjured for
him. He moved with great rapidity from Episkopi, where
he had made his headquarters in order that he might watch
both the great passes into Sphakia, Krapi and Kallikrati, to
Retimo, and thence to the attack of Arkadi, which had been
left with a small detachment of volunteers and about one
hundred and fifty Cretan combatants, including the priests.
Besides these, there were about one thousand women and
children, whom Coroneos had made every attempt to dissuade
from remaining, but, on account of the opposition of
the Hegumenos, who would not consent to the expulsion
of his own relatives, the rest could not be induced to leave
a place of traditional security, well provisioned and adequately
defended against any attack they could conceive
of. Coroneos only persuaded about four hundred to return
to their villages. The Greek commander, with the main
body of his forces, had been watching Mustapha after his
taking position at Episkopi, and followed his movements
to prevent, if possible, his investment of Arkadi. Taking
the circuit of the hills, he only reached the convent after
Mustapha's vanguard, which he engaged until nightfall,
when his men mostly withdrew to the mountains, and Arkadi
was necessarily abandoned to its fate.</p>

<p>Mustapha, arriving the next day, summoned the convent
to surrender, but, having no faith in his observance of the
conditions, the Christians refused, and the attack was
ordered. The small rifled pieces (mountain-guns) were
found to produce no effect on the walls or on the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
masonry with which the gateway had been filled up, and,
the fire from the convent being found to be unexpectedly
hot and effective, the investment was made complete, and
reinforcements sent for from Retimo, whence nearly the
whole garrison and Mussulman population came to his
aid, making the total force employed about 23,000 men,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
regulars and irregulars, being, in fact, by much the greatest
part of the Ottoman force in the island. Heavy artillery
was also ordered from Retimo, and two or three old siege-guns
were transported with great difficulty (a distance of
about twelve miles), and placed in battery; and, having
demolished the masonry in the gateway, an assault was
made, but the fire from the monastery was so vigorous
that the attacking column was unable to face it, and after
two or three assaults had failed, neither the Turkish regulars
nor their officers being willing to renew it, a body
of Egyptians were placed in front and driven in at the
breach by the bayonets of the Turkish soldiers in their rear.</p>

<p>The convent was a hollow square of buildings, with a
large court, in the centre of which stood the church. The
inner and outer walls were equally solid, and the cells and
rooms opening into the court were garrisoned with bodies
of the insurgents, who poured a hail of bullets into the
mass of Ottomans entering, but, the entrance once made,
defence and submission were alike fruitless. The troops
killed all who fell into their hands, fighting their way from
cell to cell, and bringing even their artillery into the rooms
to penetrate the partition walls. And so the struggle
of extermination was fought out, until one of the priests,
who had previously expressed to his companions the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>termination
to blow up the magazine if the convent were
entered, finding death inevitable, fulfilled his threat, and
changed what was before but a profitless butchery into a
deed of heroism, which again saved the insurrection from
the jaws of failure. The result of the explosion was very
limited so far as the combatants were concerned, and probably
did not kill a hundred Turks.</p>

<p>But even this catastrophe did not stop the carnage.
The troops recoiled, but again returned, and the last of
the combatants defending themselves in the refectory,
having exhausted their bullets, surrendered on the faith of
an oath that their lives should be spared, and were at
once put to death. At the end, thirty-three men and sixty-one
women and children were spared.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> Of the pandemonium
that the walls of Arkadi enclosed, I have heard
many and ghastly hints, and have in vain asked eye-witnesses
to tell me what they saw; they all said it was too
horrible to be recalled or spoken of. One of the most
violent of the Mussulman fanatics of Crete, who had
performed all the pilgrimages and holy works required by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the Koran, and earnestly desired as the last grace of this
life to die in the holy war against the infidels, and had
fought recklessly in all the battles he had been able
to participate in, went home after Arkadi in despair,
declaring that destiny forbade his dying the holy
death. Mustapha was a general of the old type, and
did not care to win bloodless victories or spare the lives
of his troops, and the result, apart from the moral effect,
was far more disastrous to the Porte than to the insurrection.
The losses in killed and wounded were certainly not
less than 1,500, and were estimated at a much higher
figure. The army was occupied thirty-six hours in bringing
the wounded into Retimo, and nearly 500, unable to
find place there, were brought on to Canéa (480 was the
number given me by a European surgeon in the Ottoman
service). The Pasha himself saw that he had made a
blunder, and everything which the local administration
could effect to disguise and conceal the nature of the
event was done. I had, however, fortunately sent a
trusty man to Retimo on the first intimation of the movement,
with orders to get me the most minute and exact
information possible, and his report, with the confirmation
of certain Turkish employees and submitted Christians
residing at Retimo, was in the main accepted by most of
my colleagues of the consular corps as the nearest to the
truth which had been obtained; and, though in these lands
of fable and myth no exact history can well be written,
I believe that this is substantially the truth as to Arkadi.</p>

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Mustapha immediately retraced his steps to
Canéa, and, housing himself outside the walls,
having sworn not to re-enter his capital until
the insurgents had been subdued, called a council to
plan measures to strike a quick blow at the insurrection
before the effect of Arkadi should be felt in the public
opinion of Europe. Up to that time the struggle had
seemed to me a hopeless and insane one, and though
my warmest sympathies had been, of course, with the
Cretans, as victims of a monstrous injustice&mdash;a sequence
of crimes&mdash;I had not dared utter a word of hope or encouragement
in reply to all the earnest appeals to me by
the friends of the insurrection. Now, seeing the enthusiasm
that Arkadi excited amongst the insurgents and
even the mutis (submitted Christians), I felt that there was
a hope that Christendom would be compelled to listen to
the history being enacted before it on this sea-girt mountain
ridge. That the Pasha also felt this was evident both
from his words and acts. He made new and more tempting
offers to the Sphakiote chiefs, and employed the well-known
appliances of Eastern politics to make friends
amongst the insurgents, but with only partial success. At
the same time, he made preparations for another attack on
Sphakia, but this time from the west via Selinos. He,
therefore, leaving Mehmet Pasha to guard Krapi with
four or five battalions, concentrated all his available forces
besides, at Alikianu, his <i lang="fr">point de départ</i> for the first Theriso
campaign. All this country had been abandoned, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
to be reconquered, particularly Theriso, which, if unoccupied,
would be a menace to his communications with
Canéa. At the same time, a concentration of the volunteers
and insurgents took place in the plain of Omalos,
by which alone access is had to Sphakia from this side.
A force of volunteers recently landed were engaged in a
foolish siege of Kissamos, a worthless position to either
side, as it was commanded by the men-of-war, and could
not be held if taken; and the different chiefs of the volunteers
were kept ineffective by dissensions and jealousies
amongst themselves, each refusing to obey any other.
Coroneos and Zimbrakakis, however, united their forces to
resist the attack on Omalos. The volunteers, under the
command of Soliotis, a Hellenic officer, made a gallant defence
of the position of Lakus, but were compelled to
retreat to the upper ridges which border Omalos, while
Theriso was abandoned before a flank movement of
Mehmet Pasha, obliged temporarily to leave the Apokorona
undefended. Omalos, however, resisted direct attack,
and the Pasha moved round by the passes of Kissamos to
the west of the mountains, devastating as he went, and
driving before him all the non-combatants of the country
he passed through. By this time the snow had fallen with
unusual severity of cold for that climate, and the insurgents,
although ill-provided against an inclemency they
usually escaped from in the plains below, were in
many respects better off than the troops, who were compelled
to march through ravines which were often mountain
torrents in this rainy season; and as they did not
carry tents, that they might move with greater rapidity,
and were often cut off from all communication with the
base of supplies for days together by the rain filling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
roads, at best only bad mule-paths, they suffered prodigiously
without fighting or even the encouragement of
the sack of villages. The Egyptians, clad only in linen
which their climate required, perished by cold and wet in
hundreds; pneumonia became an endemic in the army;
and, to add to the misery, the beasts of burden perished
under the hardships, and lined the paths with their corpses.</p>

<p>Mustapha was as merciless a commander as enemy, and,
though the army was suffering extreme misery, he kept a
vigilant watch for his opportunity, and when, after two weeks
of fatiguing outpost duty, waiting in hunger, rain, snow, and
frost, the Hellenes who guarded the difficult pass of St.
Irene were frozen and starved into negligence, he made a
dash, one foggy morning, surprised the post, and, taking possession
of the heights crowning the ravine, his army defiled
leisurely over into the valleys of Selinos. The Greeks
moved over to the pass of Krustogherako, which admits to
the plain of Omalos from the Selinos side, and the Pasha,
believing a defence ready, encamped in the still undevastated
valleys, and passed some days in burning and ravaging,
destroying vineyards and mulberry-trees wherever they could
be reached. The olive-trees, as the reliance of the future
income of the island, were mostly spared.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a "moral intervention" was being prepared,
which brought respite to the insurrection and deranged all
the plans of the Pasha. The atrocities of Arkadi had finally
impressed public opinion with the conviction that the old
barbarities of the Greek and Turkish wars were being perpetrated
anew; and even the English consul at Canéa
became convinced that barbaric massacre and ravage were
being employed as the means of subduing the spirit of the
islanders, and had reported to his Government certain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
these atrocities, remonstrating, at the same time, to the
Commissioner. The reports of those consuls who had by
this time become characterized as the "friends of the insurrection"&mdash;viz.,
Colucci (Italian), Dendrinos (Russian), Sacopoulos
(Greek), and myself&mdash;had spread through the European
journals the news of these barbarities and excesses to
such a degree that remonstrances were made by the ambassadors
at Constantinople, while the clear-headed and true-hearted
Murray had from the beginning, with great justice
and discrimination, measured the facts and manifested the
warmest sympathy with the Cretans. At this juncture came
H.B.M.'s sloop <em>Assurance</em>, Commander Pym, relieving the
<em>Wizard</em>, ordered to Malta. We parted from our gallant
protector with an emotion not easily comprehended by those
who do not know the nature and nearness of the dangers of
the previous four months, or how the resolute and outspoken
manhood of the young officer in his one-gun steamer had
stood so long between us and death, as the representative of
a power in civilization which subsequent years made me
honor more and more&mdash;the English navy. Fortunately,
Pym had learned from Murray, in the few days which elapsed
between the arrival of the <em>Assurance</em> and the departure of the
<em>Wizard</em>, what was the real position of affairs, and followed
the traditions of his predecessor. He had, moreover, a certain
defiance of red-tape and a feverishness to distinguish
himself which did not always measure carefully the purport
of general orders, and which, perhaps, in battle would have
made him turn a blind eye to a signal of recall, and now
disposed him to abandon on any pretext the cold-blooded
neutrality of his government.</p>

<p>Pym soon determined that a very small pretext would
suffice to make him throw himself in the way of a decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
intervention in behalf of the non-combatants, and did not
fail to exert all his influence on Dickson to obtain an official
request that he should cruise on the coast in advance of the
Pasha's army, and to "seize every available opportunity for
affording refuge to any Christian in distress who may seek
protection on board his ship," and to convey such refugees
to Greece. Pym had declared to me (and possibly to
Dickson) that he should, on his own responsibility, take
such a step if he did not get the requisition from the consul;
and, on leaving for a run to Candia, said that he should go
thence to Selinos and put himself in the way of humanity.
Under these circumstances, Dickson's humanity, further
stimulated by Murray's and Pym's enthusiasm, got the
better of his official prepossessions, and, without waiting
for a reply from his Government to a petition addressed to
all the Christian powers to send ships to save the women
and children exposed to such chances as those of Arkadi,
had followed up his remonstrances to the Commissioner
with a proposal to send a ship to pick up the families
gathered before the army in its movement into Selinos.
The Commissioner, still under the impression of the effect
produced by recent events on European public opinion,
dared not refuse his consent to such a demand from his
best friend, and, it may be conceived, reluctantly, verbally,
and evasively gave it. But Dickson, too honest and earnest
to comprehend the duplicity, took him literally at his word.
As a consequence of all these considerations and conclusions,
the <em>Assurance</em> found herself at Suia of Selinos while Mustapha
was pounding away at the passes, and took three
hundred and fifteen women and children and twenty-five
wounded men on board and transported them to Peiræus.</p>

<p>No act could have been purer or more free from ulterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
views than this of Pym's&mdash;an expression of what not only
he, but all of his fellow-officers of the English navy whom I
saw on the station, with one exception, felt&mdash;the compassionate
desire to stand between women and children and
the devilish policy which butchered them to terrify their
husbands and fathers into submission. I saw Pym and his
officers on their return from this voyage, and not one of
them but would have given a month's pay to have gone on
another similar trip. Their Government, in passing judgment
on the act, could not condemn it, but to two parties,
unfortunately, it was a political movement&mdash;the Hellenes,
who insisted on considering it an intervention in <em>their</em> favor,
and so compelled the English Government to forbid its
repetition; and the French, who regarded it as a manœuvre
to block the game of the Viceroy. The French agent who
afterwards succeeded Derché assured me that they had the
most conclusive evidence that Captain Pym had orders from
London to give the insurrection a jog, because the annexation
to Egypt would have been the result of the failure of
the insurrection at this juncture, and that, although Pym
was immediately recalled and, to all intents and purposes,
disgraced, and I believe retired on account of his venture,
he was only so in appearance, and really had been rewarded
for his apparent punishment.</p>

<p>There were, at this time, two Italian corvettes, an Austrian
frigate and gunboat, and a French gunboat, besides
the Russian frigate, all of which, except the Frenchman,
had, or were reported to have, orders to follow the lead of
any other Power in rendering assistance to the non-combatants,
and most of the commanders were anxious to follow
Pym, but their delay in learning of his venture, and
the quick disapproval of it, deterred all from intervention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and while correspondence was going on the war seemed
suspended. It appeared finally to be decided that no one
should imitate the English commander. The insurrection
seemed on the point of collapsing, through the severity of the
winter and the discouragement of the Cretans. Volunteers
had been coming over from Greece&mdash;a motley mass of
all nations&mdash;many of them from Smyrna and other Turkish
parts, who, as soon as they landed, began to breed disaffection
and maltreat the Cretans, creating the most angry feeling
in the island, which did not stop short of violence. At
this time, the whole body were driven into the Sphakian
mountains, where, exposed to intense cold, half-fed, and
without any discipline, they were dangerous only to the insurrection,
and yielded readily to proffers of the Pasha to
give them free exit and conveyance to Greece. A portion
of them accepted the proposition on condition that they
should be sent on European ships, and the Vice-Commissioner
called a council of those consuls whose governments
had naval representatives in Cretan waters, to propose that
their ships should go to receive the disaffected volunteers,
but with the condition that no non-combatants or Cretans
should be accepted. None of the commanders were willing
to accept the mission on these terms, except the French,
and the gunboat which he commanded went, therefore, to
Loutro, a port of Sphakia (the Port Phœnix of St. Paul), and
embarked four hundred and eighty men, who were landed
at Peiræus, where they were received with violence and insults
by the excited populace, and some barely escaped paying
the last penalty for their defection.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">The remaining auxiliaries, paralyzed by want of
organization, the usual dissensions of the chiefs,
and their mutual jealousies, even more than by
their want of supplies, retreated before Mustapha, who,
after some weeks of indecision, resumed his campaign;
but, instead of following up his advantages by land, and
getting possession of Omalos as a better base of operations,
and preventing the Cretans from reoccupying it, he
embarked his troops at Suia, and attempted to land at
St. Rumséli, the entrance of the ravine of Samariá, the
stronghold and place of refuge <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of Sphakia,
and where, at this time, were gathered thousands of
women and children. This movement menaced too closely
the mountaineers, who opposed the landing, and finally
repelled the attack, as well as a subsequent one at Tripiti,
nearer to Suia, when Mustapha returned to his camp in
Selmos, and passed another period of inaction, during
which the insurrectionary committees in Greece, admonished
by the imminent danger the movement seemed to
have evaded for the moment, renewed their efforts to
send relief, and threw over other bodies of volunteers,
mainly Mainotes, a hardy, courageous race, regarded as
better irregulars even than the Albanians, who, landing in
the eastern provinces, revived the insurrection where the
government was ill able to meet it. The best of the volunteers,
under Coroneos and Yennissarli, recovering from their
demoralization by rest and the removal of the more disorderly
elements, moved eastward to join the new bodies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
leaving the Sphakiotes to guard their own country. If
Mustapha, after the affair of Krustogherako, had followed
the attack up with vigor, two weeks would have finished
the insurrection. Even as it was, Sphakia being strongly
disposed to purchase freedom from conquest by neutrality,
and several of the captains having openly embraced the
Turkish cause, there seemed very little hope for the prolongation
of the insurrection, when another of those wanton
acts of barbarity, which had on more than one occasion
strengthened the insurgents instead of weakening their
courage, gave it another jog.</p>

<p>The Russian minister at Constantinople had, as soon as
the news reached that place that an English ship had
rescued a number of non-combatants from Crete, obtained
from the Grand Vizier a reluctant consent that other ships
might intervene, and despatched a steamer at once to
Crete, with orders to the Grand Admiral to commence
deportation. A violent storm favored the Turks by delaying
the avviso for several days, and, when finally the order
came, we had the news that the English Government had
disapproved Pym's acts, and the Commissioner (who had
plenary powers in all matters connected with Crete) had
withdrawn the permission given to Dickson, and both
Dendrino and Boutakoff hesitated to execute the order,
anticipating its revocation. The former, a timid, irresolute
man, master of the arts of intrigue, but lost as soon as he
had an open part to play in which he must bear the responsibility
of decision, was more concerned for his own
security than for the fate of the Christians, and hesitated to
give a requisition to the captain to move, while the latter,
indifferent to the consequences to himself, as weighed
against the relief of the Christian sufferers, hesitated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
move before getting renewed orders after the long delay,
lest he might compromise his Government in the event of
a change of its momentary policy, which was to avoid all
appearance of ultra-advocacy of the insurgent cause. It
lacked but two or three days of our regular weekly courier
when the avviso had arrived, and both the Russian officials
had decided to wait the courier before moving.</p>

<p>As for myself, since the affair of Arkadi I had thrown
aside all reserve, and, while never going beyond the limits
of moral intervention, I had used all my influence
with my colleagues, and with our minister at Constantinople
as well as our Government, to provoke acts of
positive intervention. I made no secret of it, nor did the
Turkish Government of its hostility to me. A patrol of
zapties watched my front door, and another my back door,
and no Cretan dared enter my house. I was regarded as
the postman of the insurgents, and so complete was the
delusion that the authorities entirely neglected to watch
my colleagues, two of whom daily received and sent letters
to the mountains. All the little persecutions which a petty
local government could inflict were laid on me, and I
reciprocated, as I best could, by disseminating news of the
true condition of the insurrection, and stimulating the
activity of my colleagues. Mr. Morris, our minister at
Constantinople, at first strongly under the influence of the
English ambassador, the just and liberal Lord Lyons,
became convinced that nothing was to be expected in the
way of humane intervention from England, and passed entirely
over to the Russian policy, and lent me his whole
prestige and influence, made himself my defender at the
Porte, and gave me instructions after my own drawing
up. I made common cause, therefore, with my Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
colleague, on whose irresolution I managed, in most cases,
to impose my resolutions, and, little by little, gained all
the control over him which I desired for critical emergencies,
while I flattered his <i lang="fr">amour propre</i> by giving him
the credit of making up his own mind. I had also organized
a sort of news agency, by which I was able to get
the earliest and most reliable news of all movements in the
island, so that gradually not only the consuls but the
naval officers came to expect from me the most reliable
information.</p>

<p>During the few days of suspense between the arrival of
Boutakoff's orders and the arrival of the courier which
should confirm or revoke them, the act of brutality to
which I have alluded came to quicken decision. I had
received news that a Turkish frigate, hoisting English
colors, had run in near the coast of Sphakia, and when the
unfortunate refugees, expecting aid, came down to the
shore, the Turks opened on them with shot and shell. A
Turkish cannonade is generally a pretty harmless affair,
except for accidental casualties, but the affair gave me all
the justification I needed to put a pressure on Dendrino to
issue a requisition for the Grand Admiral to go at once to
the south coast of the island. That night the post steamer
was due, and, from the absence of any despatches to the
Italian commander similar to those to the Russian, I anticipated
that the movement had failed, and that counter-orders
would come to Boutakoff by the post. I went at
once, therefore, to Dendrino, and, putting the most energetic
pressure on him, dictated a letter to Boutakoff, who
was on board the frigate at Suda, requesting him to get
up steam and go to the Sphakian coast without delay, and
did not leave till I saw the messenger on the way and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
beyond recall, knowing that if I left Dendrino it would stop
there. Boutakoff, nothing loth, fired up at once, and at
nine <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> was on his way. At midnight the post arrived, as
anticipated, with counter orders, but too late. Except
myself, no one was so glad that the countermand failed as
General Ignatieff, the Russian minister.</p>

<p>The Grand Admiral went to Tripiti, where were thousands
of non-combatants hiding in caves and living
amongst the rocks, waiting the relieving European ships,
but when the Russian boats ran in they were fired on by
the Cretan guards, made suspicious by the Turkish frauds.
Once assured of their friends, however, the people swarmed
out of their holes like ants, and, as Boutakoff told me,
in a few minutes the whole coast was lined with them,
more than he could possibly stow. He took about 1,200,
and sailed for Peiræus.</p>

<p>This deportation had a triple effect: first, in strengthening
the Russian party in the island by assuring the Cretans of
the good faith of the Russian Government, that party having
been hitherto very inconsiderable; second, in relieving
a large body of men of the care of their families; and, third,
in deciding doubtful and uninvaded districts to take up arms,
and breaking off the negotiations between the Commissioner
and the Sphakiote chiefs, by which the former had hoped to
have Sphakia given up without combat. The most tempting
offers were refused, and the people of Eastern Sphakia,
under the command of old Costa Veloudaki, entered on the
war-path again, and, surprising a Turkish post at Episkopí,
drove the garrison, with serious losses, back to Retimo; and,
near the same time, Coroneos and Korakas on one slope of
Ida, and Petropoulaki, the chief of the Mainote volunteers, on
the other, harassed and drove back all the outposts in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
open country, and shut up the Turks of the central district in
the fortress of Retimo; while some battles, better worth the
name than the desultory skirmishes which most of the combats
had been, were fought in the open country around Candia,
where Reschid Effendi proved himself a shrewd and capable
strategist, and drove the insurgents back to the western
slopes of Ida after sharp fighting, in which the dissensions
of the Greek and Cretan chiefs were more conspicuous than
their wisdom; but everywhere the insurrection showed new
vigor.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>This despatch was immediately communicated to Mr.
Morris; by him to the Hellenic minister at Constantino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>ple;
and thence to the committee at Athens; thence to
the insurgents, through whom it rapidly spread and confirmed
their warlike resolutions. The Russian commander,
like Pym, had been obliged to desist from any new attempt,
and waited for our steamer to come. The Italian commanders
were eager to avail themselves of their standing
instructions to follow the ships of other nations in this work,
and so a new phase of the struggle awaited the appearance
of the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mustapha Pasha, skirmishing along the coast
of Sphakia, bargaining and cajoling the chiefs of the formidable
Sphakiotes, wasted his time and troops in fruitless
encounters and under the inclement season. At length,
unable to proceed by land, and compelled by his programme
to pass through the canton, he embarked all his troops at
Suia, and transported them to Franco Castelli, where there
is a plain country between the mountains and the sea, and,
after negotiations with the chiefs of the villages on the south
slope, was permitted to go, without molestation, through the
defile of Comitades into the plain of Askyfó, where he encamped
to receive the submission of the Sphakiotes. What
were the inducements which permitted him to pass by a
ravine where one hundred resolute men could have destroyed
his whole army, I do not know; but it is hardly conceivable,
considering subsequent events, that it was owing to
any general complicity of the mountaineers, but probably
to the defection or bribing of that chief whose place it was
to guard the shore end of the defile near which his village
was. He had long been known to be a warm personal
friend of the Pasha, and had on one occasion prevented a
blockade-runner from landing her cargo on his territory.</p>

<p>The day after Mustapha had entered Askyfó, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
captains of that section came to me to ask for counsel, saying
that they were undecided whether to submit or fight, on
account of their families; but, if the foreign ships were coming,
as they had heard, they would attack Mustapha in Askyfó.
I replied that I could in no wise counsel him, or
make myself responsible for what they should do, but translated
for him Mr. Seward's despatch, and told him that I
expected daily a ship, and that as soon as she came she
would go, in company with the Russian, to the coast of
Sphakia, and relieve the families there. He returned to
Askyfó, and a council was held, at which it was decided to
attack Mustapha at once. The Pasha, warned by his spies,
broke up his camp at midnight, and, when the Christians
gathered at the head of the defile of Krapi at daybreak, they
found the heights guarded and the rear-guard of the Turkish
army already entering the ravine. The Christians were
but six hundred men, but they attacked at once. The
pass is not a simple gorge, but a precipitous pass, in some
places divided by sub-ridges with only mule-paths, and in
some passages very bad at that, the way being partially
choked with boulders and overgrown with scrubby oaks,
amongst which the Christians concealed themselves in
squads, and fired on the passing troops in security and deliberation,
sometimes even throwing stones on them. The
latter lost all order, and in confusion and separate parties
passed through, scarcely having the courage to stop and
return the fire. An attendant of the Pasha, who rode at
his side (when the path permitted), told me that the balls
were like an infernal hail, and that the Pasha pushed through
without stopping to make any defence. Defence was impossible,
indeed; for no rear-guard dared make a stand,
with the certainty of being blockaded and cut off when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
main body had passed through. The Egyptians&mdash;timid as
sheep in danger, but brutal as wolves when they had to deal
with defenceless Christians&mdash;paid the penalty of their cruelty,
and received no quarter. The native guides saved themselves
in the rout, and many of the troops, confused in the
intricacies of the way, hid themselves in the thickets, where,
for several days after, parties were discovered and despatched,
no quarter being given.</p>

<p>What the losses were was never known, returns not being
to the taste of the old irregular, or consoling to his Government;
but when the army reached the Apokorona and reassembled,
it was reported by Mustapha (official report,
February 6, 1867) at 6,000 men, too large an estimate in the
opinion of the officers of the men-of-war at Suda, who witnessed
the defile as they debouched on the plain of Canéa,
whence they had gone out for the Theriso campaign, in
October, 17,850, with eight guns, by the official statement
to Mr. Dickson (Cretan Blue Book, Mr. Dickson's despatch
of October 15, 1866), besides several thousand irregular reinforcements.
The commander of one of the Italian ships,
who took the trouble to count some of the battalions, reported
one of them to me at less than 300, and this an
Egyptian battalion which had come 900 strong. It was
evident to all in Canéa that Mustapha's administration was
an utter failure. The spring had come; new bodies of
volunteers had been thrown into the island, and the trips
of the blockade runners continued without a single disaster.
The Turkish forces, which, at the assumption of the command
by the Commissioner, had been above 30,000, were
now, by my estimate, less than 20,000. The official reports,
as usual, chanted victory, but the under-officials at
Canéa were not so reticent, and a profound gloom settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
over the whole Mussulman population. The more energetic
of the Turkish commanders openly attacked Mustapha's
cautious policy, and demanded a more dashing campaign.</p>

<p>Mustapha, by way of reply and justification, gave to
the most noisy of his insubordinates a division to attack
the insurgents at Omalos, where the prudent, if a little useless,
Zimbrakaki commanded a body of volunteers, and was
supported by Hadji Mikhali with his Lakiotes, Criaris, one
of the bravest of Crete, with the Seliniotes, and all the men
of the destroyed villages of the Rhizo and Kissamos, a
desperate throng which every movement of the Turks did
but increase. Ali Riza Pasha, to whom the movement was
entrusted, unwilling to risk again the twice-attempted road
by Lakus, made his attack by a pass further to the west,
which led to a declivity by which approach to the plain of
Omalos was possible but not easy, and which the Cretans
call <i lang="gr">kakoi plevroi</i> (bad slopes). The assault was against
men hidden amongst huge fragments of rock and brushwood,
and, though obstinately pushed, made no headway,
and the troops, after losses, as usual unreported, retreated
to Hostí in the valley, where they were followed and surrounded
by the Cretans, and all communication was cut
off with Canéa for two or three days. Here Hadji Mikhali
performed one of those feats which recall the old days of
Greek heroism. Descending at night with a small party
of picked men, he cut his way through the Turkish camp,
and disappeared on the other side. The Turks began an
indiscriminate firing of musketry and artillery in every direction,
and kept it up until daylight. Mikhali was certainly
the most remarkable character developed by the insurrection.
The son of a chieftain of the same name, who is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of the traditional heroes of the "great insurrection" (1821
to 1830), he inherited an influence, with genuine strategic
abilities and undaunted courage, which, with great personal
prowess, made him the terror of the Turkish authorities.
I have often remarked the unconscious adaptation of
Homer's description of Achilles used by the Cretans in
speaking of Mikhali, his most-dwelt-on characteristics being
his beauty, his swiftness of foot, and immense strength and
stature.</p>

<p>Ali Riza was only rescued from the hands of the Cretans
(for M. Zimbrakaki never ventured from his safe retreat,
though he had now an opportunity to destroy the whole
division of Turks by an energetic and concentrated attack,
and the Hadji had to work with his own people) by a strong
column from Canéa opening up the way for his retreat; and
with the abandonment of this plan all hopes of making any
impression on Sphakia were abandoned, the more as all the
villages now took up arms and threw off any pretence of
composition.</p>

<p>In the eastern provinces, at the same time, Reschid
Effendi, organizing an army including all the disposable
forces at Candia and Retimo, estimated at 10,000 men,
moved to attack the volunteers and Cretans under Coroneos,
Petropoulaki (chief of the Mainotes), Korakas, Skoulas,
and others, for once fortunately united, in Amari, the
broken country on the western slope of Ida. Their plan
seemed to be to pass through the canton to the south shore,
and return by the plain of Messara and the eastern slope
of the mountain to Candia. The Christians drew the whole
force of the Turks into a difficult position at Yerakari, and
then, by a vigorous hand-to-hand attack, cut the column in
two, the smaller half pursuing the proposed route, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
being driven back to Retimo, losing baggage, two guns,
and quantities of ammunition and provisions. The smaller
detachment, pursued, were overtaken at St. Thomas, where
they had halted to rest, and again routed and pursued to
the neighborhood of Candia.</p>

<p>Both the divisions of Ali Riza and Reschid, in returning,
avenged themselves on the submitted Cretans in their way.
The following extract from a letter from Lieut. Murray to
Mr. Erskine, English Minister at Athens, characterizes the
position of things in the whole island:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Canea</span>, February 24, 1867.<br />
</p>

<p>"Things appear to get worse and worse, and the end
appears further off than it did six months ago. To-day
the troops returned from an unsuccessful attempt to force
a passage into Omalos, partly owing, they say, to the plain
being covered with melted snow, but in a great measure
owing to the stubborn resistance offered by the insurgents
under Zimbrakaki. What the next move will be I am as
yet unable to say; report says they are going to Kissamos.
I fancy, unless reinforcements arrive, they will soon have
to withdraw inside the fortified towns.</p>

<p>"<i>February 25.</i>&mdash;A sad tale was told to me yesterday. A
shoemaker living in Canéa, and well known to all as a quiet,
peaceful man, fled to the hills when the insurrection broke
out. There he followed his trade till three months ago,
when, the country round Canéa appearing to be pretty
quiet, he came and settled at the village of Fourna, in the
plain of Alikianu. A few days ago, his wife ran in and
said, 'There are soldiers coming into the village.' He replied,
'Don't be alarmed, they have been here before.' A
few minutes afterwards, two soldiers dragged him out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the house, and beat him so that they broke his arm, which
caused him to faint. His wife brought him some water, as
did also an officer, and left him. Shortly afterwards, while
he was still unable to rise, two other soldiers came up and
despatched him with their swords. This is the history of
one out of eighteen killed in the same village that day, told
me by his poor wife, who, together with her four children,
came to seek redress from Mustapha Pasha. He gave her
two hundred piastres, and said he would enquire about it.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to tell you that the troops have again gone
out&mdash;one division to Kissamos, the other to Apokorona.
The people are again flying to the hills before the advent
of the troops, and I greatly fear more atrocities."</p></blockquote>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapb.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">By this time, the Powers had learned how
utterly mendacious all the Turkish official
reports were, and that the insurrection was
further than ever from being suppressed; and the Porte,
dreading the effect of the knowledge of the utter failure
of the Imperial Commission from which it had promised
itself such immense results, developed a new plan, in which
the <i lang="fr">douceurs</i> of a <em>plébiscite</em> were to be administered by its
armies, and a new assembly constituted, who were to sit at
Constantinople, and represent both the Mussulman and
Christian populations as an advisory council on the new
measures of reform which were to pacify the <em>conquered</em>
islanders. The most curious of all the strange characteristics
of this affair were the persistence of the Turkish Government
in misinforming Europe of the position of the struggle,
and the willingness of official Europe to be misinformed.
Now, at a moment when every corps of the Turkish army
had been defeated, the Porte, with a ludicrous gravity
which would have been comical in the extreme if one
could have forgotten the misery of starvation, of barbarism,
death by cold and fire and sword, with atrocities without
name which were momentarily being perpetrated by its
authority on the helpless victims of its paternal tenderness,
sent to Crete its ablest diplomatic agent, Server Effendi,
with the following proclamation, nominally addressed to
the Commissioner, but really to the Powers, Server Effendi
being actually the plenipotentiary, Mustapha being in dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>grace,
but openly honored by an honor as delusive as the
victories by which he had secured it:</p>

<p>"It is needless to tell thee that we are deeply grieved at
the insurrection which has been fomented in Crete by ill-intentioned
people, at the evils which have resulted from it
to the inhabitants, and at the blood which a cruel necessity
has forced to flow. If, notwithstanding all their
efforts, our Government have not been able to prevent
these misfortunes, if the paternal advice which they gave
to the misguided inhabitants, in order to bring them back
to the line of duty, have remained fruitless, the responsibility
must wholly fall, before God and the tribunal of
public opinion, upon the instigators of these calamities.</p>

<p>"The wise behavior, however, of the islanders who,
understanding the real state of things, remained faithful to
us, and, on the other hand, the bravery of which our Imperial
army has given most signal proofs in fighting against
the insurgents, as well as the wise measures which thou
hastenedest to take, have powerfully contributed to restore
peace and security in all parts of the island, with the exception
of such as are infested by the presence of foreign
brigands. Those islanders who, giving way to culpable
insinuations and deluded by false promises, have some time
followed these seditious agents, have hastened to profit by
the general amnesty granted beforehand, and have returned
to their duties. A committee has therefore been formed in
our capital for the purpose of examining and framing a
future mode of administration of the island for the new
Governor, who is to be sent there as soon as matters shall
have reassumed their normal condition. Thus the committee
will have to look to the best means of repairing the
ills sustained by the country, to perfect the administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in conformity with the legitimate and indispensable wants
of the people, and to effect thus that prosperity which results
from the development of agriculture and commerce;
in a word, they will have to procure a general bettering of
the condition of the country. But for these measures relating
to the government of the island to succeed, and for
the welfare and prosperity to be realized, it has been deemed
necessary to consult likewise some of the principal people
of the island, who enjoy the confidence of the inhabitants.
On the suggestion, therefore, of our Government, we have
approved of and instruct thee to proceed to the election,
by the inhabitants, of one or two notables, Mohammedans
or not, taken in each district, and to send here as soon as
possible those who may have been selected. Be careful to
bring to the knowledge of the public the present Imperial
firman, and to be at the same time with the inhabitants of
the island the interpreter of the good intentions with which
we are animated towards them."</p>

<p>Server Effendi was really a most intelligent and (for a
Turk) humane administrator, and, had he not been crippled
by the necessity of keeping up the absurd pretence of an
actual conquest achieved, might have found some sortie
from the difficulty, which would have arrested the train of
disasters which afterwards brought the Porte so near to its
final quietus. He made himself no delusions, and, I believe,
propagated none at Constantinople. In point of
fact, no one of the responsible governments there was now
deceived; but the Sultan had passed into a monomaniacal
condition of fury on the subject of the conquest of Crete,
and no Grand Vizier could have remained in office who
proposed an abandonment of the war without conquest.
The powers, except England, counselled the Porte to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
yield a principality, and it is probable that, if England had
acceded, the Cretans would, at that time, have accepted
this solution of the question in spite of the Hellenic influence.
The policy of England has always seemed to me
mistaken to Turkey and faithless to the Cretans, for, in
effect, all the powers signatory of the protocol of February
20, 1830, were morally bound to secure to the Cretans a
similar condition to that of Samos. But it must at the
same time, be admitted that this policy was open, consistent,
and, so far as Turkey was concerned, loyal, while that
of France was double, disloyal to all her allies, wavering,
and entirely egotistic; and that of Russia was consistent
only in its unfaltering hostility to Turkey, and its willingness
to favor any affair that promised to weaken her empire.
The tactics of Greece were of a nature to make the
chances of Crete more precarious than they need have
been. The policy of Crete for Greece, rather than Crete
for her own good, made confusion and jealousy in the conduct
of the war much greater than they need have been.
What the Cretans wanted was a good leader, arms, and
bread. Greece sent them rival chiefs without subordination,
a rabble of volunteers, who quarrelled with the islanders,
and weakened the cause by deserting it as soon as they
felt the strain of danger and hardship; and if, after the first
campaign, they were more wise in enrolling men to go to
Crete, they still allowed the jealousies and hostilities of the
leaders to go unchecked by any of those measures which
were in their power. But the radical fault of the Hellenes
was that they compromised the question by the introduction
of the question of annexation, and forced it into the
field of international interests, disguising the real causes
and justification of the movement, and making it impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
for England consistently with her declared policy to entertain
the complaints of the Cretans without also admitting
to consideration the pretensions of the Hellenes. If the
latter had not intruded their views on the <i lang="fr">tapis</i>, the former
might have been heard; but, from the moment in which
annexation to Greece became the alternative of the reconquest
of Crete, the English Government could clearly not
interfere against the Porte without upsetting its own work,
and if, in some minor respects, especially the question of
the principality, she had been more kind to Crete, no one
could have found fault with a policy which was, in its general
tendency, obligatory on her. Her great mistake was
in not recognizing more clearly the utterly irresponsible
nature of the Turkish administration, and compelling the
Porte to redress the wrongs which even Dickson, philottoman
as he was to the last degree, could not ignore the reality of,
before they had passed into the arbitration of arms. I believe
that, if Lord Lyons had had the direction of affairs
from the beginning, he would have composed the difficulty
without bloodshed, for he saw clearly and understood the
real merits of the question.</p>

<p>Server Effendi succeeded in naming deputies from nearly
all the districts of the island, and in compelling most of
them to go to Constantinople. One escaped, and came to
my house to ask asylum. Of course I was compelled to
give it, and he remained for six weeks my guest, when he
escaped, disguised as a Russian sailor, on board a Russian
corvette, and went to Greece. The others were sent under
guard to the capital, where they also demanded protection
from the Russian Legation, declaring that they came
against their own will, and that of the Cretan people; and
so in effect ended a farce, put on the stage with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
appliances of the Turkish Government, and played with
their best actors.</p>

<p>The arrival of a new swift steamer from England, for the
purpose of running the blockade, gave a new <i lang="fr">élan</i> to the
insurrection, and the <em>Arkadi</em> (formerly the <em>Dream</em> of American
blockade celebrity), was from this time until her
destruction in August of 1867 an element of the first importance
in the war. The former blockade-runner, the
<em>Panhellenion</em>, was a slow steamer, never making above nine
miles per hour, and her success in provisioning without a
mishap the insurrection for nearly a year, with a squadron
of thirty ships to watch her, is one of the most surprising
instances of capacity on one side, or incapacity on the
other, in the history of marine warfare. The <em>Arkadi</em> not
only brought arms and supplies, but she carried away at
almost every trip numbers of non-combatants, and
formed a safe and reliable means of communication between
Greece and Crete, by which messengers, supplies of
all kinds, and every requisite for the war were transported
with tolerable certainty. The warm weather enabled the
insurgents to re-enter the field in greater numbers, and
it finally became evident that the war was to be one which
would only be finished by the exhaustion of the resources
either of Greece or Turkey.</p>

<p>A change in administration at Athens had brought a
more capable and thoroughly national council into power,
under the presidency of Mr. Comoundouros, the ablest and
clearest-headed statesman of the Hellenic kingdom, who
had discouraged an appeal to arms until the war became a
<i lang="fr">fait accompli</i>, when he advocated a policy of aid to Crete
<i lang="fr">coûte qu'il coûte</i>, and, on assuming power, made the insurrection
his chief care. The whole resources of Greece were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
devoted to it, and the funds of the insurgent committee at
Athens were fed directly from the national treasury. There
was, no doubt, scarcely any disguise about the complicity;
but public feeling in Greece was so thoroughly enlisted that
no government could have existed which did not unmistakably
favor the insurrection. Unfortunately for the success
of the Greek plans, the government did not impose on
the Cretans an effective organization and a supreme commander.
It still based its chief hope on European intervention,
and counted on a limitation of the struggle by their
influence, instead of preparing to act in the most complete
independence. There was some excuse for this in a statesman-for-the-moment,
in the fact that intervention had already
begun by the overtures of Russia, acceded to at this
date by France, whose Emperor was at the juncture ready
to come to an understanding with the Czar on the basis of
mutual concession; but Comoundouros should have seen
that the readiness of Greece to endure and prolong a war
with Turkey would be the best argument for the intervention
the former desired. Greek politics have always had
the fault of being based on sentimentality, and calculating
too much on the sympathy of Christendom and classical
scholars, neither of which has ever played a noteworthy
part in modern Hellenic history, for even the genuine philhellenism
of 1821 would have accomplished nothing had it
not been that Turkey stood in the way of Russian combinations.
The Greeks seem never to comprehend that governments
are purely political, and never influenced by sentiment
or religious affinities. They count that Hellenism
and Christianity must always be weighed in the Eastern
question, and in this case calculated on forcing the hand of
the Christian powers by these appliances; while if they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
proved that they were capable of conducting the war with
energy and good system, preparing themselves meanwhile
for a war with Turkey, Europe must have interfered, as a
war between Greece and Turkey involved too momentous
questions to be risked for so small an affair as Crete, and
Christianity might have got the casting vote in deciding
which side interference should favor. If Russia had been
sincere in her friendship for Greece, she might have helped
the question to a speedy ending by giving the word to the
Danubian provinces to rise; but she has never desired a
strong Hellenic kingdom, and this Comoundouros understood
clearly, and that any intervention voluntarily made
by Russia would be for her own interest purely, and that,
holding as he did the initiative in a movement of all the
Christian races, he could, by the employment of it, compel
Russia to favor his plans or lose her prestige with them,
and to a great extent her moral influence. It was with this
view that he prepared movements in Epirus and Thessaly,
while Montenegro became agitated, and the seeds of the
Cretan trouble seemed wafted over the whole Turkish Empire.</p>

<p>Pending the question of intervention, the transport of families
waited the arrival of the American ship, of which no
advices came. I telegraphed to Admiral Goldsborough for
news of her, and received reply that he knew nothing of
any orders for Crete. Subsequent information showed that
our Secretary of Legation at Constantinople, a Levantine,
and, like his class in general, devoted to the Turkish Government,
and a most rancorous and persistent assailant of
both Mr. Morris and myself in the journals of Europe and
America (and whom the disgraceful condition of our diplomatic
service permitted to assail the acts of his superior and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the declared policy of his own government), acting in the
interests of the Turkish Government, had put himself in
communication with the naval authorities by the intermediation
of officers attached to the squadron in European
waters, and instigated the revocation of the decision of the
Government, and, when finally the <em>Canandaigua</em> arrived in
the middle of March, she had orders to do nothing in any
way disagreeable to the Turkish authorities; and I soon
found that the state of feeling in the navy was anything but
favorable to the employment of our ships for humane purposes,
I myself, as instigator of their discomfort, being
treated by the officers with a degree of incivility which showed
as little good-breeding as <i lang="fr">esprit de patrie</i>, and was manifested
so openly as to encourage the local authorities in their
systematic persecution of me. With the exception of two or
three of the younger officers, the whole wardroom broadly expressed
their sympathies with the Turkish Government, so
that, after having persuaded Captain Strong, who sympathized
somewhat with the awkwardness of my position, to
run down to Retimo with me to look into the condition of
the Christian families shut up in that town, I saw the <em>Canandaigua</em>
sail, with a heartfelt desire not to see one of my country's
men-of-war again while I was on the station. The Commissioner
showed his appreciation of our official servility by
ostentatiously ignoring the visit of Captain Strong, passing
the <em>Canandaigua</em> by without notice, while he visited all the

<p class="drop-cap">To compensate myself for the slights of my fellow-countrymen,
and at the same time escape from
and retaliate for the annoyances of the Turkish
officials, I sent to Corfu for a little cutter-yacht, and until
it came sent my family to Syra. All official intercourse
had ceased between the Commissioner and myself, and,
encouraged by our Secretary of Legation, who maintained
a correspondence with the dragoman of the Commission,
the Pasha showed his determination to drive me out of
the island. It was forbidden to let me a house, the one
I had having become untenable from the number of
military hospitals gathered round it. I found it almost
impossible to be served in the market, which was under
official control, and every movement I made was so
watched, and locomotion made so dangerous by the random
discharges of the muskets of the irregulars, which were
fired off on all occasions, and even with none, the balls
constantly being heard passing overhead, that I determined
on passing the summer on board the <em>Kestrel</em>, which
I did, running from port to port in the island, and over to
the Greek islands, whenever the fancy took me. In this
way I revenged myself most agreeably. My satisfaction
was greatly increased by seeing the disgrace of my adversary,
the Commissioner, who was recalled, having utterly
failed in everything but devastation. He was replaced by
Hussein Avni, a cautious and heavy-witted man, a good
disciplinarian, but a most fanatical Mussulman, and so forewarned
of my dangerous qualities that I found, to my great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
amusement, that I was considered the head and front of the
insurrection. As with all the espionage they could apply,
no act of complicity could be discovered, I was credited
with superhuman cunning, it never entering the heads of
the <em>rusés</em> Mussulmans that I had nothing to conceal, and
that, while they were watching my house at Kalepa, the insurgent
messengers came in at the city gates almost every
day. In fact, except as a witness of events, I had ceased
to be of any importance to the insurrection; and, entirely
unsupported by any moral or diplomatic influence of my
own Government, and wearied of a struggle which brought
to me but a succession of spectacles of misery and barbarity,
I would gladly have left the island, where the extraordinary
expense of living was devouring my substance without
any recompense, but that I had become in public opinion,
both in Greece and Crete, so identified with the existence
of the insurrection that my resignation or recall would
have been a danger to it in the eyes of its friends. The
moral intervention of my own Government amounted to the
despatch before quoted, a fustian despatch from Mr. Seward
to Mr. Morris about "the brave and suffering Cretans,"
and a buncombe resolution of Congress, in view of which
the people of the East, having to deal generally with governments
whose words have a positive value, supposed
that we were the friends of the Cretans, and I determined
to avail myself of the delusion, as far as my own position
was concerned, and conform to what was really public opinion
in America, confident that the Government cared nothing
about the matter <em>pro</em> or <em>con</em>. The Porte threatened
to revoke my exequatur. Nothing would have pleased me
better, for I knew that this would compel my Government
to do something, and Ali Pasha seemed to have the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
opinion, for the threat was dropped. A strong pressure was
then applied at Washington to have me recalled, and Mr.
Seward had consented, and decided to call me home, I was
informed, under pretext of consultation on some public
affairs; but General Ignatieff, getting wind of it, telegraphed
to St. Petersburg that I must be retained, and a telegram
from there to Washington settled the matter, I conjecture,
as nothing more was heard of it. This I believe was the
extent of the part performed by the American Government,
and, trivial as it was, it seems to me the least creditable
played by any government concerned.</p>

<p>Hussein Avni was only the <i lang="la">locum tenens</i> of the Serdar
Ekrem, Omar Pasha, whom the Porte had decided on
sending to Crete as a final and reliable agent, his name
being, as was supposed, so formidable as to discourage any
protraction of the resistance. In the interregnum, Hussein
undertook no measures against the insurrection. Ali Riza
Pasha, being beaten at Topolia in an attempt to penetrate
into Selinos, where a new gathering of volunteers and insurgents
had been made, contented himself with ravaging
the plain districts of Kissamos which had hitherto escaped.
Whole villages, which had submitted without any resistance,
were plundered, the women violated by order of the officers,
until in some cases death ensued; and of the men, some
were killed, others beaten and tortured in many ways, all
who could escape taking refuge in the caves and hiding-places
along the shore, where they escaped by small boats
to Cerigotto. I ran over later in the <em>Kestrel</em>, and saw several
hundred of these miserable wretches, women and children
mainly, and saw two row-boats arrive with their lading,
so crowded that it was a marvel how they could have made
the passage of twenty miles or more of open sea, in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
weather. I saw one old blind man of ninety who had been
wrapped by the soldiers in cloths on which they poured
oil, and then, setting them on fire, left him to his fate. His
friends came back in time to save his life, but I saw the
broad scar of the burning, covering nearly his whole chest.</p>

<p>Omar Pasha arrived on the 9th of April, and on the 11th
a body of 2,000 insurgents came down to the heights of
Boutzounaria, and attacked the guard of the aqueduct, to
show his Highness, apparently, that they were not discouraged.
They were driven back with the loss of three killed,
the plan of attack having been betrayed by a miller in the
neighborhood, and the troops been reinforced in the night
before the appointed day. At the same time, a more decidedly
offensive strategy seemed to be adopted by the whole
insurrection, owing to the new material brought over by the
<em>Arkadi</em>, and in several places combats of comparative importance
took place. The insurgent chiefs made no concealment
of their satisfaction at the change in the command,
fearing the wiles and personal influence of Mustapha
more than all the artillery and discipline of the Generalissimo.
Omar had landed with great pomp and circumstance&mdash;horses
and guns, cavalry and a staff, new and
splendid uniforms. Amongst the others I paid my respects
to the new victim, and found him, to my surprise, a weak,
conceited, bombastic old man. He assured me that his
plan and appliances were so complete and irresistible that
within two weeks from the time he set out the insurrection
would be crushed. I ventured to suggest that he would find
on getting into the interior that the work was much more difficult
than he imagined, and that the neglect of the Porte to
construct good roads when they had command of the island
made their work very difficult. He replied that it could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
be more difficult than Montenegro, and he had conquered
that, etc. I left him with much less apprehension for the
success of the campaign than I had previously entertained.
He was a strong contrast to the quiet, concentrated, <em>rusé</em>
Mustapha.</p>

<p>The political intervention of Russia commenced at this
juncture by the negotiation of a secret arrangement with
the Viceroy, by which he engaged to withdraw his troops
from Crete, and a division was actually embarked for Egypt
before the Serdar Ekrem succeeded in arresting the defection,
which was completed on his return from the campaign,
seven months later, when a number, which, with the
previous departure, amounted to about 10,000 men, the
remainder of a total of 24,000 Egyptians landed in Crete,
returned to Egypt. The change in French policy was also
marked by the recall of the slavishly pro-Turkish consul
Derché, incapable either of honesty or good policy, and
whose demoralization had made him worthless even to his
own government, and the replacing of him by M. Tricou,
a clever, quick-witted Parisian, but long in the service, and
lately stationed at Alexandria. There seems to be little
doubt that he was authorized to use his eyes to the disadvantage
of Omar Pasha if possible. [Tricou arrived just
too late to be received by Omar before setting out, and followed
him to Candia with the intention, if not the order,
to follow him through his campaign; a surveillance which
Omar bluntly declined, to his cost, as events proved.]</p>

<p>He occupied about two weeks in organizing his troops,
receiving heavy reinforcements from Turkey, including
some splendid-looking regiments with full ranks, and then,
with about 15,000 men, set out for the conquest of Sphakia.
The Cretans, as if to reply to the new manifesto of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Porte, formed a provisional government, and chose Mavrocordato,
an able Greek administrator, and most trustworthy
and patriotic man, as president, decreeing at the same time
that all authority should be exercised in the name of the
King of the Hellenes. But the difficulty, not to say impossibility,
of reconciling the claims of the rival chieftains, and
of enforcing any kind of administrative system in the
island, deterred Mavrocordato from assuming his post,
though the <i lang="la">brutum fulmen</i> of proclamation on both sides
still continued, the only practical question being which
side would stand most killing. Strategy on either side was
of trivial importance, tactics of none. The Cretans rolled
stones and felled trees into the passes, already nearly impassable,
and Omar and his staff planned, on the chart, a
campaign for a country none of them had ever seen, and
with the greatest contempt for the judgment of those who
knew it. Mehmet Pasha, who still retained command in
the Apokorona, though he had been obliged to retreat to
the seaside, advanced anew, and formed an entrenched
camp near Vrysses, while Omar, with the bulk of the army,
moved on to Episkopi, and waited there the arrival of the
troops at Retimo. When all were ready, a joint attack was
made, by Mehmet on Krapi and the Serdar Ekrem on
Kallikrati, a much longer but less precipitous pass, which
led into Askyfó from the east.</p>

<p>Zimbrakaki, with Veloudaki and other Cretan chiefs, and
Soliotis of the Greeks, commanded at Krapi, and Coroneos
at Kallikrati, and the affair ended as had all the former
attacks, Mehmet being driven back to his camp, and Omar
to Episkopi. These were affairs of sharpshooters entirely,
where no opportunity of employing discipline for the
attack offered, and the troops exposed themselves to a fusil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>lade
which they could not reply to. But, with the irritation
of defeat, the Ottoman Generalissimo gave way to the most
brutal impulses of revenge. Villages which had just submitted,
and whose people had remained within the Turkish
lines, were put to sack, and the last outrages of war perpetrated
on the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The rumor which accompanied the Serdar Ekrem, that
in spite of his professions of moderation and legality (as
opposed to Mustapha's policy) he had secret orders to
stamp out the disaffection by the severest rigor, found
now clear confirmation. What under the Commissioner,
subsequent to Arkadi, was variable and overlooked barbarity
in the subordinates, was, under the Generalissimo, the
law and order of things, and he himself partook of the
plunder of the defenceless, and rejuvenated the lusts of his
old age with the pick of the captive Cretan maidens. The
testimony of several of the European officers in the army
was offered me, proving that Omar Pasha dishonored even
his adopted country by his violation of his word, by his
depravity and his cruelty, and himself set the example to
his army of everything which could add to the misery and
despair of unhappy Crete.</p>

<p>It is as natural for the Turkish authorities to deny as for
the Christians to exaggerate the atrocities committed, but
evidence of a nature not to be rejected, or even questioned
in its general import, establishes that the policy adopted
was one of subduing Crete by terror, and to this end
full license was given to the soldiery. One entry in a
memorandum book kept by Geissler (Dilaver Pasha),
Omar's chief of artillery, and which I had the chance to
read, said, noting the entry into one of the villages near
Goïdaropolis: "O. Pasha ordered the division to ravage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and rape." All villages were burned, and all prisoners
murdered or worse. The chiefs of four villages who came
to make their submission were at once beheaded. The
population invariably fled to the high mountains on the approach
of the troops.</p>

<p>It will hardly be edifying to follow further in detail this
barbarity; and with the general statement that the policy
here indicated was followed throughout Omar's campaign
unflinchingly, and that the French consul was refused
permission to accompany Omar in his movements, that no
civilized witness might bring his deeds to light, I shall drop
the theme, which sickens me to recall even at this long interval.
My duty then compelled me to investigate, as now
to declare, these things, but I spare the civilized world
and myself any further recital of the deeds of the Croat
Pasha.</p>

<p>The 6th of May a force of volunteers, commanded by
Dimitrikarakos, landed in the eastern provinces, where up
to that time hostilities had been very unimportant. A large
body of insurgents quickly rallied round the volunteers,
and, establishing their headquarters at Lasithe, they swept
the country up to the walls of Candia. This compelled a
new concentration of forces to meet the new emergency,
and Omar set out, via Retimo, through Mylopotamo to
Candia, sending word to Reschid Effendi to come to meet
him <i lang="fr">en route</i>. Coroneos, meanwhile, had not been idle,
and while Zimbrakaki and Costa Veloudaki, with the Apokoroniotes,
some volunteers, and most of the Sphakiotes, remained
to keep Mehmet in check, and profit by an unguarded
moment to attack him, Coroneos and his followers
kept near the army of Omar Pasha, waiting until he should
be entangled in the ravines of Mylopotamo to attack him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and when he had reached Margaritas, he was beset furiously
by the whole body of the men of Agios Basilios and the
Amariotes, with the volunteers who accompanied Coroneos.
The Turks, shut into narrow ravines overlooked by
bold heights, defended themselves with difficulty, and were
soon entirely hemmed in, unable to advance or retreat.
The fire of the Cretan rifles penetrated into every part of
the Turkish encampment, Omar's tent being several times
pierced. At a council of war, called on the emergency, the
opinion was general that the position was critical, and some
considered it as next to hopeless. There was nothing to do
but take shelter and wait for Reschid and his irregulars,
who, well acquainted with the mountains and the Cretan
method of fighting, would be able to form an advance-guard,
and, by skirmishing vigorously, protect the march
of the regulars, utterly helpless in this kind of warfare.</p>

<p>The passage of the troops through this section was described
to me by several eye-witnesses as anything but military.
They cowered at the first attack, and refused to move
forward in the ravines except when preceded by a cloud of
irregulars to drive back the Christians, every onslaught of
whom produced a panic; but, as they were behind as well
as before, retreat was impossible, and there was no alternative
to the Turks but to take to such defences as the ground
permitted and defend themselves as they best could. The
Albanians and Circassians were not sufficiently acquainted
with the country, cut up with interminable ravines, covered
with olive groves, and defended by men who knew every
inch of the ground. The wretched Turks lost all courage,
even that of despair, and a European officer in the Egyptian
service who was present said to me that most of his
comrades entertained no hope of escape, and Coroneos has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
since assured me that if the other chiefs had responded to
his call for help, the total destruction of the army, including
the Serdar Ekrem and his staff, was practicable.</p>

<p>As has generally been the case in Greek wars, the jealousies
of the chiefs were the safety of the Turks. Petropoulaki,
a Mainote palikari of the old war, who commanded in
Malavisi and Temenos, and watched Candia from the eastern
slopes of Ida, refused to come to the aid of Coroneos;
and when Reschid moved from the east, entered the defiles
of Mylopotamo at Damasta, instead of throwing himself
before the Turkish division and delaying their advance, he
attacked them in the rear after they had gone through, and,
though he inflicted severe losses on them and took much of
the baggage, he rather facilitated than otherwise the junction
of the two Turkish corps, and, after a short pursuit,
abandoned him, instead of following up and uniting with
Coroneos. Skoulas, chief of Mylopotamo, alone kept up
the chase, and Coroneos, warned in time of the advance of
Reschid, despatched a small body of men to oppose his
junction with Omar. Reschid, however, with the greatest
obstinacy and gallantry, hammered away regardless of loss,
and, fighting all night long, effected his junction, with
which Coroneos's hope of bottling up Omar was lost. The
Generalissimo embraced Reschid as his saviour, and promoted
him on the spot. What made the matter still worse
for the Cretans was that their ammunition was exhausted,
and supplies did not arrive in time, so Coroneos reluctantly
fell back, leaving the way open. The next day his ammunition
arrived.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">On the march forward through Mylopotamos the
troops avenged themselves for their flight and
losses in the most barbarous manner. Olive-trees
were burned and cut down, every house burned, and
every luckless Christian who fell into their hands sent with
short shrift to his account. The European officer above
alluded to declared to me that he was an eye-witness of the
oft-repeated incident of burning the refugees in one of the
caves, around the mouth of which a huge pile of green
wood was piled, and fired while the troops hurried on,
without waiting to see what the result might be; and so
reached Damasta only slightly opposed, and debouched
on the open country of Candia.</p>

<p>This occupied from the 18th to the 20th of May. The
Turkish army then concentrated near the remains of
Gnossus, and without entering into Candia moved on to
Pediada, where Omar established his headquarters at Castale,
near the foot of the Lasithe Mountains. He now
announced his plan, which was to sweep round the insurgent
forces, and push them all westward into Sphakia,
where he would shut them up and finish the war. That he
entertained no such expectation, however, was evident from
the order of his attack on Lasithe, which he made at a
single point, so as rather to disperse than gather in the
insurgents. The 3d of June he sent Reschid to attack the
northern pass of Lasithe, by Abdou. The column of irregulars
entered the little plateau, which is as an ante-chamber
to the great plain of Lasithe, without opposition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
his men at once camped, and began to cook their supper,
or whatever else the desire of the bashi-bazouk might be.
They were, in this state of confusion and security, suddenly
attacked by the Cretans, and utterly routed and driven
back to the plains below, leaving their dead and wounded
on the ground. The news of the disaster followed the
despatch announcing the entry so closely, that both became
known in Candia that same night. Reinforcements were
continually arriving, and the Pasha had now in the field
for the attack 18,000 men. With these he renewed the
attack on Lasithe in two directions, from Abdou on the
north, and from the west by Mathea and the pass which
was defended by the mountain called Lasithe Effendi&mdash;a
very strong position, but in a state of defence in no ways
equal to its natural advantages. The insurgent force gathered
in the Lasithe at this time was the largest the insurrection
had ever seen assembled, and is estimated by competent
assistants at about 5,000, but with no head, though
many commanders. The force was sufficiently well organized
to have defeated Omar Pasha, but, after three days'
cautious skirmishing, the Turks penetrated on several sides,
the irregulars turning Abdou by a difficult and undefended
approach at the east, and the insurgents retired in disorder
and in every direction; some by Messara into the Ida
district, but the larger portion into Rhizo Castron, south of
Lasithe, and the higher ridges of the Lasithe range, which
Omar did not attempt to penetrate.</p>

<p>On hearing that Omar had arrived at Candia, and was
about attacking Lasithe, I ran down in the <em>Kestrel</em> to
watch his movements from nearer, and get more reliable information
than the consular agents there generally furnished,
as well as to convey more promptly the news to Greece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and Constantinople, the agents only reporting back to their
superiors at Canéa. On the arrival of the first news of the
entry of Reschid into Abdou, Omar sent off an express
with the news to Syra and Constantinople, but when the
later report came, of the surprise and repulse, I was able,
to the great annoyance of the authorities, to send by the
Austrian post steamer, which left the next day, to correct
the advices by the new information which I received from
the son of Reschid Pasha, who was in great anxiety for the
fate of his father, a raid of the Christians having temporarily
cut his communications with headquarters. For two or
three days the panic and confusion in Candia were extreme.</p>

<p>Orders were then issued for the bulk of the army to
concentrate at Dibaki, and Omar moved across the plains
of Pediada and Messara, Reschid taking a line further
west by St. Thomas and the slopes of Ida, while the troops
who had moved further into the Lasithe country attempted
to pass directly to the coast. Two battalions of Egyptians
in this movement were caught in the ravines of Sime, and
almost annihilated, leaving baggage, arms, and mules,
loaded with ammunition and provisions, in the hands
of the Cretans, who hung on the rear of every detachment,
harassing more successfully than they had opposed
them.</p>

<p>At Dibaki the army was reorganized for the Sphakian
campaign. It was the beginning of July when it began to
move. The fleet had been waiting at Dibaki some time,
and embarking the bulk of the regulars, still strengthened
by fresh troops from Constantinople, they were landed at
Franco Castelli, and took immediate possession of the
heights commanding Kallikrati. The forces under Coro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>neos
were on their way to oppose this movement, but, moving
by land, were too late, and Zimbrakaki and his Sphakiotes
made no opposition. Reschid, meanwhile, moved from
Dibaki through Agios Basilios, his march being facilitated
by the assassination of the chief of that district, which left
the Christians without a head, and paralyzed their defence
in great measure, though opposition enough was made to
render his march slower than the plans of Omar had provided,
and gave time to Coroneos to get to Kallikrati,
where he immediately commenced operations by an attack
on Omar's positions on the hills south of the plain. He
began the combat with forty men, who were rapidly increased
to 1,500, whom he divided into two bodies, of
which the heavier, massing unperceived on the left flank
of the Turkish position, after the defence had been
concentrated against the feint made by Coroneos himself,
charged energetically, and carried the two positions
on the Turkish left. The ground was very favorable to
irregular operations, rocky, with much small growth of
trees, making artillery useless. The Cretans held the positions
taken, and in them prepared an attack for the day
after.</p>

<p>On this day the insurgent force had augmented to 2,000
men, and the plan of operation was a slight variation only
of that of the day before, the feint being on the left, but,
unfortunately for it, the order to the commander who
should have made the real attack was kept in the pocket
of the officer who carried it until an hour after the time
at which the assault was ordered to be made, so that though
the diversion of Coroneos was very well carried out, and
the Sphakiotes under him penetrated to an abattis which
had been constructed around the principal position of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Turkish army on a conical hill called Avgon (the egg), the
expected flank attack was not delivered, and the troops
who had held the positions on the right had time to concentrate
against Coroneos, and he was driven back. Preparations
were, however, made for the third day, with forces
still increasing, when the news that Reschid had arrived at
Gaiduropolis, and consequently menaced their rear, demoralized
the Cretans, compelling Coroneos with his volunteers
to fall back on Askyfó.</p>

<p>Mehmet Pasha, once more attacking Askyfó by Krapi,
while Omar's troops and Reschid with his bashi-bazouks
passed by the mountains from Kallikrati to Asfendu, and
so into Askyfó, had been opposed by Zimbrakaki, Soliotis,
and the Sphakiote chiefs for three days, when, finding the
defence concentrated at the head of the gorge, he climbed
the hills at his right, passed over into Askyfó, took possession
of Kares, on the edge of the plain, barricading himself
there without attempting to advance further. Coroneos,
on his retreat to Askyfó, threw a force of several
hundred Sphakiotes and volunteers behind him, and for
several days his communications with Canéa and his base
at Vryses were cut off, when Reschid succeeded in getting
into Askyfó and supplying him with provisions, of which
he stood much in need, having left Vryses with six days'
rations, and now been twelve days out without further
supplies. Zimbrakaki had retired to the heights between
Askyfó and Anopolis, followed by Omar's forces, while
Reschid occupied the southeastern part of Askyfó, Mehmet
being in the northeastern. The indefatigable Coroneos
took position at Muri with about 800 men, and thence
menaced the communications between the latter chiefs, and
so effectually that Mehmet was obliged to evacuate Askyfó,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and get back to Vryses, when, falling on the rear of
Reschid, Coroneos compelled him to fall back to Kallikrati.
The Greek chief then placed himself between Omar
and his auxiliaries, and watched both, ready to attack
either when the development of their plans should tell him
what to do. Omar pushed on to Anopolis, and thence to
Aradena, where he was gallantly opposed by a small force
of Greek volunteers under Smolenski and Nicolaïdes. The
Greeks, attacked in front and on both flanks, while Zimbrakaki,
at an hour's journey, remained idle, and Petropoulaki,
a league away, guarded an unattacked pass, were forced
to fall back, and leave Aradena to the Turkish troops, after
a display of courage which called forth the praises of their
enemies. But here the defences of nature stopped the invaders.
The great stronghold of Sphakia, Samaria, was
impregnable from the side of Aradena, the mountains
hardly giving place for undisputed passage to pedestrians.
The troops were accordingly withdrawn to the sea-side, and
as the shore gives no passage, a detachment was carried by
ships to the entrance of the gorge of Agios Roumeli. An
energetic assault penetrated as far as the village which gives
name to this valley, a distance of half a mile, but here the
Cretans, concentrating in numbers, and aided by the masses
of rock and torrents, stopped all further advance, and the
troops were withdrawn; and, their passage through Sphakia
to Canéa being barred, they were sent round by sea, leaving
the country as hostile as they had found it, but desolated
and ravaged as the "<i lang="it">paese guasta</i>" never had been before.
The losses of the army in this campaign had been frightful.
The sun of July, beating on those bare rocks with
southern slopes, with rare and unhealthy wells, fatigues of
climbing and battle, merciless driving and pushing to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Omar to telegraph to the Sultan at Paris the conquest of
Sphakia, had been a hundredfold more fatal to the Turks
than Cretan bullets. Sunstrokes and dysenteries carried
off hundreds. Amongst the deaths was that of Geissler,
Omar's chief of artillery, in whose journal the writer read
after his death these words: "Who could have believed
that I could ever have assisted in the subjugation of these
unhappy Christians!" He had done his utmost at the
beginning of the campaign to check the barbarities by
which it was sought to terrify the Cretans into submission,
and having remonstrated with Omar for one case of peculiar
and repulsive atrocity, a coolness arose between them,
which continued until Geissler's death.</p>

<p>Omar reached Canéa by ship August 30, not having
even done as much towards the conquest of the island as
Mustapha, no division of his troops having passed from sea
to sea except by the plain of Pediada, etc. His losses
since leaving Canéa cannot be estimated at less than 20,000
to 25,000 men&mdash;the estimate made by the most competent
persons of the total force employed in the Sphakian campaign
being not less than 45,000, while, on leaving, he himself
declared that he had not over 20,000 troops, all told, in
the island, and European officers in the service declared to
me that this was an overestimate.</p>

<p>Returning for a moment to follow Reschid in his retreat
from Sphakia, we shall so conclude this campaign. Waiting
a day or so at Kallikrati, he seemed undecided what course
to take, and Coroneos watched him, fearing a raid on the
undevastated district near Kallikrati, but, urgently summoned
by the Assembly to Sphakia to resist Omar, he was
on the way to obey, when he received news that Reschid
had broken up his camp, and was in retreat on Dibaki.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
He instantly sent messengers to the men of Agios Basilios
to hasten to stop the way at Halará, a most difficult pass
of their canton, while he followed him with all the forces he
could muster. Flight and pursuit were rapid, but when at
Halará Coroneos overtook the Mussulmans, he found no
force in Reschid's way, and that he had occupied the pass
without resistance. Pursuit recommenced next day, and in
passing by Amari, Reschid escaped an ambush of the
Amariotes by taking an unused and difficult way in preference
to the commonly travelled one at which they lay in
wait for him, and, incessantly harassed, and losing men and
baggage continually, was caught again by his Greek adversary
near Melambos, in a parting fight, in which, it is said, he
received a wound from which (or from some other cause)
he died a few weeks later at Candia.</p>

<p>This was the general result of the great expedition which
would end the insurrection in two weeks. Nothing had
been gained, an army wasted; and when, on October 3,
the remnant of Egyptian troops left, there was no Turkish
force out of gunshot of the fortresses except a small garrison
at Dibaki, under the guns of the fleet.</p>

<p>With the practical and complete failure of Omar Pasha
to subdue the island, all hope of military success seemed to
fail the Turkish authorities. Omar returned from Sphakia
with his army by sea, save a body left in Selinos, who made
an expedition on Omalos, and, after penetrating with slight
resistance to the plain, found themselves unable to keep up
their communications with the coast, and abruptly evacuated
it again, suffering considerable loss in forcing the
passes outwardly. The elastic system of resistance adopted
by the Cretans, and finally acceded to by the Greek chiefs,
wore out the Turkish forces without giving them the pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>tige
of tangible victory. There were no fortresses to capture,
no accumulation of stores to destroy, and the very
poverty and want of military coherence made a strength
for the insurgents in face of the wretched strategy of the
Turks.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Another step of the <em>moral</em> intervention which
the Russian Government had been so long and
so skilfully engineering came at this juncture
to make the cause of the Porte more hopeless. The
negotiations with France had resulted in a kind of <i lang="fr">entente</i>
on the Eastern question, by which the French emperor
had agreed, under certain contingencies, to unite with
the Russians in deporting the families of the Christian
combatants. The new French agent, Tricou, had from
the beginning shown a tendency to criticise Omar Pasha
unfavorably, which the latter had increased by his contemptuous
treatment of the new consul. Tricou had, consequently,
set his agents to find out all the instances of
Turkish barbarity obtainable&mdash;a ghastly roll, obtained from
easily read records. It happened during the operations
against Sphakia, which Omar nominally directed from on
board the flag-ship of the squadron off the coast, that news
came in of his having blockaded a number of families in a
cave on the sea-side and having attempted unsuccessfully
to stifle them out (or in), and the active Murray went at
once to make his Highness a visit, and ascertain if the catastrophe
were avertible. He obtained from the Generalissimo
a promise that the prisoners should not be attacked
by any inhuman appliances, and should be guaranteed
honorable treatment on surrendering.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> In the course of
the conversation, Omar animadverted on Tricou in terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
which Murray, in narrating his visit to me, declined to
repeat, and which, in all their vagueness and possible
malignity, I at once applied as a caustic to Tricou's already
wounded pride, in accordance with a systematic policy
to make all the bad blood possible between the Pasha and
my colleagues. The ruse succeeded to my best hopes, and
thenceforward the irritated Frenchman sought every opportunity
to punish the illustrious renegade, and his activity
resulted in the following despatch, sent while Omar was
still engaged in the Sphakian raid:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><small>(Translation.)</small></p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap"><small>Canea</small></span>, <small>July 21, 1867</small>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. le Chargé d'Affaires</span>:</p>

<p>The situation grows daily worse. I have had the honor
of notifying to you the deplorable excesses which have
been committed in the district of Kissamos; to-day I learn
that massacres have broken out in the eastern part of the
country.</p>

<p>For the last month, isolated murders took place daily in
the neighborhood of the town of Candia; the native
Mussulmans overran the country and abandoned themselves
to the saddest iniquities in the Christian villages.
These barbarous expeditions over, they would return to the
town, and the gates opened before them to give passage to
their bloody trophies. I had made strong complaints to
the local authorities, but all my representations had remained
without effect. Emboldened by impunity, the
bashi-bazouks on the 12th and 13th of this month spread
themselves over the district of Rhizo and massacred women
and children. To revenge themselves, the insurgents carried
off a young Turkish girl and killed her father. The Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Government, which has for a long time forbidden
Christians to enter the town, doubtless counted upon these
atrocities remaining buried in silence. They let them go
on, and the irregulars could glut their ferocity entirely as
they pleased.</p>

<p>On the 17th, they invaded the villages of Huméri, Alcolohuri,
Aghias Paraskevi, Shilus, and a great number of the
villages of the district of Pediada, murdering the peaceable
and defenceless villagers, old men, women, and children.
The consular agents of Candia unite, and wish to send
their dragomans to the places; but the Governor opposes
this, and the carnage continues.</p>

<p>These sad tidings have deeply moved the consular body.
As soon as I had been informed of them I went to the Imperial
Commissioner, whom I found, I must say, deeply
afflicted, but overwhelmed with the feeling of his impotence.
He no longer attempts to deny the evil, but he
feels himself incapable of staying its progress. From all
parts of the island the most sinister reports reach us. Women
and children wander along the shore, dying of hunger
and exposed to the most horrible treatment. I am in a
position to inform you, M. le Chargé d'Affaires, that three
young Turkish officers, witnesses of the barbarities which
have taken place at Kissamos, have given in their resignation,
to avoid presiding over such butcheries.</p>

<p>In so serious a situation, my English colleague and I
thought it our duty to inform our respective governments
in the promptest manner. We consequently drew up the
following telegraphic despatch, which we sent this day to
the Peiræus to be transmitted to Constantinople, as well as
to the Cabinets of London and Paris:</p>

<p>"Massacres of women and children have broken out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the interior of the island. The authorities can neither put
down the insurrection nor stay the course of these atrocities.
Humanity would imperatively demand the immediate
suspension of hostilities, or the transportation to Greece of
the women and children."</p>

<p>The Russian and Italian consuls address an identical
telegram to St. Petersburg and Florence.</p>

<p>We cannot, M. le Chargé d'Affaires, remain blind to the
fact that from impotence the Turks passed to fury, and from
fury to extermination. I do not hesitate to say that, if this
useless struggle were to be prolonged, the women and children
would have no refuge but exile or death.</p>

<p>Omar Pasha continues his expedition of Sphakia. It is
asserted that he has effected his junction with the corps of
Mehmet Pasha, which is said to be entirely free. It would
be very desirable that the Serdar should make himself
master of this position as soon as possible; it is true that
the insurrection would be scarcely weakened by it, but this
success might perhaps induce the Porte to order a suspension
of hostilities.</p>

<p>The aviso of the Imperial navy, the <em>Prometheus</em>, which
has come to relieve the <em>Salamander</em>, anchored on the 17th

</blockquote>

<p>The consequence of the Russo-Frankish accord was that,
on the receipt of the above despatch at Constantinople,
the French and Russian squadrons at Peiræus proceeded
to Crete, and there commenced to embark the families
gathered along the coast. This undertaking, which had
probably as little as possible to do with humanity in its
secret springs, was evidently concerted, and waited only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the arrival of some signal like Tricou's telegram, followed
accordingly by this preconcerted rejoinder from the French
representative at Constantinople:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">
<i>M. Outrey to A'ali Pasha</i>.</p>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap"><small>Therapia</small></span>, <small>July 26, 1867</small>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Highness</span>: The consul of France at Canéa sends me
the following telegram [given above].</p>

<p>"In view of such acts, which the Porte can but reprove,
and in virtue of orders which I have received from my
Government, I hasten to inform your highness that I have
ordered Admiral Simon to repair to the Cretan coast with
the ships under his orders, to receive and transport to
Greece all the women and children who wander on the
shores, dying of hunger, and exposed to frightful treatment.
The mission of Admiral Simon, having no political character,
cannot, I imagine, meet any difficulty from the Ottoman
authorities, and I beg your highness to have the goodness
to instruct his Highness Omar Pasha to lend all his
sympathy to a work of humanity."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is made clearer by the extract from the despatch
of the English <i lang="fr">chargé</i> to Lord Stanley:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<small>(Extract.)</small></p>
<p class="center">
<i>Mr. Barron to Lord Stanley (Received August 6).</i></p>
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap"><small>Constantinople</small></span>, <small>July 23, 1867</small>. &nbsp;
</p>

<p>"The French <i lang="fr">chargé d'affaires</i> has called to inform me
that, having received instructions from his Government to
despatch vessels to Crete for the purpose of removing
homeless victims of the war, whenever it should be advisable,
he deemed the last advices from the French consul at
Canéa (enclosed herewith in copy) to be such as to oblige
him to use the discretionary power placed in his hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
On the receipt of this despatch he immediately concerted
measures with the Russian Ambassador, who was provided
in advance with corresponding instructions, and they both
sent late on the 26th identical instructions by telegraph to
their respective naval officers in the Mediterranean."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number of relieving ships sent to Crete in obedience
to this accord was four French, three Russian, followed
by two Italian; and, lest isolation should seem intervention,
three Austrian, not over well-willed, and one small
Prussian gunboat, that the now great Power might not be
left out of the new question.</p>

<p>This movement had, in my opinion, no direct effect on
the military question, the Sphakian expedition having
already done its worst, and begun to recoil, before the
arrival of Admiral Simon with his ships; but it did, no
doubt, prevent the success of the conciliatory movement
which followed. The Generalissimo, after his return to
Canéa, about the middle of September, issued a proclamation
prepared at Constantinople, offering a general amnesty
and an armistice of six weeks, preparatory to measures of
a softer and more persuasive character. The Turkish officials,
in their intercourse with the consuls, frankly admitted
that force had failed, and that no hope of its more successful
appliance remained. The depleted army could only
with great difficulty, and slowly, be refilled. Reinforcements
were obtained, but not enough to keep the cadres at
their full condition, and a despatch of the English consul
at Beyrout<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> attests the dread of this service which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
infected the troops in other sections of the Ottoman empire,
while battalions in Crete mutinied and refused to labor any
longer.</p>

<p>Early in October, A'ali Pasha arrived, to put in effect the
sober second thought of the head of Islam. The manner
and views of the Grand Vizier impressed me with profound
respect and sympathy&mdash;his proffers seemed to me reasonable,
and likely to assure to the Cretans a substantial liberty
and reform. But they were too shrewd not to see that the
ablest man in the Turkish empire had only come to Crete
to try the last resort of his persuasion, because his case was
nearly hopeless, and simultaneously with his arrival came
stimulating despatches from the Russian agents, encouraging
the Cretans to hold out and strike now the final blow
at the Turkish domination. They were assured by these
despatches in the most positive terms that if they withstood
this temptation, and refused all the conciliatory propositions
of A'ali Pasha, their independence and annexation to Greece
were certain. I feel confident that but for these assurances
the scheme of A'ali Pasha would have been accepted, for
the island was harrowed and ravaged and miserable to the
last degree. The campaign of Omar Pasha had destroyed,
according to the declaration of a European officer engaged,
six hundred villages. Except in Sitia, the extreme
eastern peninsula, there was hardly a house with its roof
on, and the people had no means to provide new rafters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
The discouragement was great, and required as counterpoise
all the confident promises of Russia and the means
and appliances of Greece to induce the people to decide to
keep up the resistance.</p>

<p>My own opinion was that the Cretans had better accept
A'ali Pasha's propositions, but our minister at Constantinople
wrote me to urge their rejection with all my influence,
as the certain condition of independence. I do not believe
that our Government had any part in these instructions
or policy. Mr. Seward had at one time given me
the fullest endorsement of my pro-Cretan views, and at
another was ready, on the remonstrance of the Turkish
minister, to recall me for having done what he approved
both in myself and Mr. Morris, and abstained only on
another application being made by the Russian Government.
Being on the spot, and as well able to judge as any
one, it seemed to me wisest for the Cretans to accept autonomy
and peace, but I obeyed the instructions sent me
against my own feelings. I communicated the advices of
my minister to those whose business it was to advise the
insurgents. I felt a confidence in A'ali Pasha which no
other Turkish official had ever inspired me with, and a certainty
that he would act in good faith. Humanity demanded
peace in defiance of all politics.</p>

<p>Dissensions had arisen between the volunteers and
Cretans; and the chiefs of the former, wearied of a
pointless and resultless guerilla warfare, and sure that
the question was only to be settled on the continent,
in order to hasten the preparation of movements on
Epirus and Thessaly, one by one returned to Greece, followed
by most of their retinues. The Cretan combatants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
relieved of their families, were quite sufficient for all the
needs of the situation, and, well armed and provided, could
have kept up the struggle for years, if disposed.</p>

<p>But the fatal blow to the insurrection was being prepared
by its own friends. The Russian Government had, during
the nuptial visit of the King of Greece to St. Petersburg,
secured a complete ascendency over him, and immediately
on his return to Greece it became evident that the dismissal
of the Comoundouros ministry had been decided in that
conclave with the execution of whose plans no motive of
humanity ever interferes, whose deliberations no curious
House of Commons pries into or clamoring journal opposes.
The Russian Government had decided to take the direction
of the insurrection, and to that end, to get rid of Comoundouros
and his friends, whose anti-Russian tendencies were
too strong to be bent to the desired course, the king,
when the moment had arrived, made a difference with the
ministry on some trivial point, and peremptorily dismissed
it. But the chamber, with an unexpected constancy, refused
to sanction any change in the administration, and
the Russian minister in Athens then made overtures to the
dismissed president of the council, offering to bring him
back to power if he accepted the programme of St. Petersburg.
He refused, and the chamber, unyielding, was also
dissolved, and in the new election, in which the whole influence
of the court and throne was exerted against the
Comoundouros party, by the most violent and illegal
measures the deposed chief and his principal adherents
were kept out of the new chamber, which was, to a sufficient
degree, subservient; and Bulgaris, the evil genius of
Greece since her independence, under whose auspices at
all times disorder and dishonesty, brigandage and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>peculation,
had especially thriven, became the arbiter of the
destinies of Crete.</p>

<p>At this time all means and supplies for the war came
directly from the Hellenic treasury. Private contributions
had never been great, and were almost exclusively confined
to Greeks abroad&mdash;a comparatively trivial supply of food
and clothing from America being the exception. Nearly
50,000 refugees from Crete were dependent on the Hellenic
Government, which, with the means supplied to the war
committee for military operations, constituted a drain on
the resources of Greece sufficiently alarming, yet popular
opinion was so strong in favor of continuing the insurrection
that no government dared seem even to be lukewarm
towards it; and with excellent opportunities for observing,
I am able to assert confidently that the Hellenic people
were ready to run all the risks of war with Turkey, rather
than allow the Cretans to be reconquered, and that no
government could have lived a day which did not proclaim,
as the chief condition of its existence, the vigorous support
of the Cretan insurrection.</p>

<p>What the views of Russia were in regard to the insurrection
no outsider can, of course, say; but they seemed to
be in favor of only making the Greek agitation a part of a
great scheme, having its direction at St. Petersburg.
The only immediate change, however, in the direction
of the insurrection was the gradual suppression of
the powers of the Cretan committee at Athens, and an
occasional relaxation in the vigor of support, as if to try the
condition of public feeling. I judge that Russia had made
other combinations, which made the success of the insurrection
as a Hellenic movement undesirable, and that she
was gradually getting it in hand, to be able to suppress it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
when the proper moment came. To do this without sacrificing
that influence over the Hellenes which would be so
useful in certain contingencies, it was necessary to have a
Hellenic instrument to do the work&mdash;hence the position of
Mr. Bulgaris.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">In judging of such acts as the intervention of
Russia, we have no standard but success, and
the greater or less fitness of one of the participants
to rule; but from the point of view from which I
must look at it, the conduct of Russia seems to me as the
most base, cruel, and politically dishonorable which I have
ever known, being, as it was, practised on a wretched people,
co-religionary, whose sufferings had been extreme, and
which, being offered a tangible and not inconsiderable
concession in return for its efforts, was only induced to
refuse it from faith in Russian promises of better things.</p>

<p>A'ali Pasha landed on the 4th of October, and on the
13th Captain Murray reported to his Government: "The
insurgents have thrown away a golden opportunity in the
advent of A'ali Pasha, for I believe, short of annexation,
they might have anything they asked for. Whether the concessions
would be temporary or not, is a matter of opinion;
but his mission has completely failed." This was clear to
all, and in December following, the highest Christian functionary
of the Turkish Government in the island said to
me: "We have got to come to the principality with a Christian
prince, and that before it is too late to gain even that&mdash;we
have nothing to hope for from arms."</p>

<p>Yet in a desultory way fighting went on. Omar Pasha
went home in disgrace on the 11th of November, but left
for his successor, Hussein Avni, a plan for paralyzing the
insurrection, by lines of block-houses running across the
island and cutting it into three principal parts, each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
which was then to be subdued in turn. But if the Cretans
had been weakened by the withdrawal of the most of the
volunteers, the Turks were enfeebled by sickness and
extreme dejection, and the war was languidly carried on,
the Turks maintaining themselves within their fortified lines
and now and then making a sortie on some bold party of
insurgents, the principal affair of the winter being an attack
on Zurba, on the 13th of December, which was, like all
the previous ones on the village, repulsed with disaster.
And under such auspices&mdash;the insurrection, less disputed on
its ground than at any previous period, holding posts within
sight of Canéa; the hospitals of the island filled with
sick troops (at and about Canéa alone were an average of
3,000 in the hospital, with unexampled mortality from hospital
gangrene and fevers, and the funerals ranging from
ten to twenty per day); supplies very low, and the troops
only paid three months' pay for the last twenty&mdash;the year
1867 went out and the third year of the insurrection came
in. And all through the spring and summer this state of
things continued, neither the Government nor the insurrection
capable of making the feeble effort necessary to extinguish
the forces of the other. We in the Turkish lines
suffered almost as much as if we were in a besieged town,
for supplies from the interior were cut off, and they came
not by sea; meat was very dear and poor, vegetables rare
and sometimes unattainable, so that I was shut up in my
house for three months with a scorbutic malady. What the
unfavored must have suffered may be conceived. Despondency
and gloom were dominant in all official circles.
Building of block-houses went on slowly, but there were not
troops enough left in the island to garrison all that were
planned, while on the other hand the Hellenic Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
gave only assistance enough to keep the insurgents from
surrendering, and the Greeks from revolution, which would
have been the most probable result of the open abandonment
of the insurrection. In August of this year, I had
unmistakable proof of the reality of the insurrection, having
witnessed a skirmish between Zurba and Lakus, and narrowly
escaped being taken prisoner near Theriso, with some
of my colleagues and several officers of the men-of-war in
port, Mr. Dickson and a portion of our excursion party
having been actually captured by Hadji Mikhalis' forces
within an hour's walk of Canéa.</p>

<p>This season brought no change in the military position,
there being a gradual weakening of the army until only
about 5,000 regulars were disposable for field operation, and
a total of less than 17,000 were reported to me by Turkish
officers as the effective remaining from 82 battalions of
Turkish troops, which with 22,000 Egyptians were the
regular forces employed since the commencement of the
insurrection, and of which only 10,000 of the latter had been
since sent home otherwise than as sick or wounded.</p>

<p>In September of 1868 I left Crete under medical orders,
and with the impression, generally felt in Crete, that the
Hellenic Government was about abandoning the insurrection.
On arriving at Athens, where I determined to wait
the result, I found the Cretan committee so far convinced
of the bad faith of the Bulgaris government that they
meditated resignation <i lang="fr">en masse</i> as an appeal to the people,
and to discharge themselves of all responsibility for the
impending collapse of the revolt. The Minister of Foreign
Affairs soon after waited on me at my house to beg me to
use my influence with the committee to persuade them to
hold on, assuring me in the most earnest manner that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Government had no intention of withdrawing its support
from the Cretans, and that it intended organizing an
expedition on a most effective scale to reassure and
reanimate the movement; and that it had the intention of
directing this organization officially to ensure its efficiency.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Provisional Government of the island had
made an earnest appeal to Coroneos to return and assume
the command-in-chief of the insurrection, and he had prepared
a plan by which he was confident of keeping up the
war through another winter by a judicious employment of
Cretan forces. His plan was accepted by the committee,
but, on being laid before the Government, was rejected under
the pretence that the sum demanded (£10,000) was beyond
its means, and it proceeded without reference to the
committee to organize at more than double the expense an
expedition under the old Mainote palikari, Petropoulaki, in
so open and undisguised a manner that, with most other
friends of the Cretans, I was convinced that it was meant to
give Turkey an opportunity to <i lang="fr">brusquer les choses</i> by (what
Greece had hitherto avoided) <em>open</em> violation of international
law.</p>

<p>Every subsequent movement of the Government confirmed
me in this opinion. The bands paraded the streets
openly with the Cretan flag; were furnished with artillery
from the national arsenal; and embarked in two detachments
for Crete, unmolested by any of the Turkish ships,
though all the world knew when and where they were
going; on landing they sent back the artillery, and not only
made no offensive movement, but did not even defend
themselves; the smaller detachment being cut to pieces in
a few days, the other, fleeing in disorder to the plain of
Askyfó, made overtures at once for surrender, carrying with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
them in their defection most of the Cretans of the western
provinces. There still remained in the eastern provinces a
strong nucleus of insurrection undismayed even by this
apparent disaster, and capable of rallying 5,000 men.
In compliance, however, with what has always seemed
to me a preconcerted plan between the Porte and Bulgaris,
Hobart Pasha, the new English commander of the
Turkish fleet, waylaid the <em>Ennosis</em> blockade-runner in
Greek waters on her return from Crete, and pursued her
into the port of Syra, where he blockaded her with the
whole squadron, leaving the coast of Crete utterly unguarded,
though there were still three good steamers at
the disposal of the committee. But in the new excitement
of this patent outrage on international law the
Bulgaris government found its opportunity to withdraw
all support from Crete, and, while public opinion was
diverted to the not slight chances of war with Turkey,
further supplies to the insurrection were cut off and it
collapsed almost without notice.</p>

<p>In all this shaping of events there was no disguising
the control of the Russian Government. The insurrection
became a menace to bring on the Eastern question, for
which Russia was not yet ready, and which she could
not permit to be brought on under Hellenic auspices.
The moment could not have been more auspiciously
chosen for Greece to carry on a war with the Ottoman
empire, and public opinion in Greece was unanimous in
favor of this emergency rather than abandoning Crete,
be the risks and event what they might. The Turkish
army was already fully occupied&mdash;a further levy of
troops would have been perilous, and Joseph Karam
waited at Athens the signal to arouse the Lebanon. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Greeks had little money, but the Turks had comparatively
less, for their army and navy had not been paid, were discouraged
and mutinous, and the treasury was empty.
Egypt was hostile, the Principalities ready to revolt. My
own opinion then was, and is still, that if Greece had gone
to war she had a reasonable chance of victory&mdash;not without
disasters or great sacrifices, but her history has shown
that she is capable of enduring both the one and the
other; and if Russia had been friendly to her in this
crisis, success would have been <em>most</em> probable. The
Bulgaris administration, its object gained in the suppression
of the insurrection, was in its turn overthrown by
the popular indignation at the discovered trick, but when
the diplomatic flurry had passed, and tranquillity had returned
to the Ægean, we had only to see drift over to
the shores of their kindred land the débris of one of the
best justified and best deserving revolts against misgoverning
tyranny which modern history has recorded. All was
quiet in Crete.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_YEAR_AFTER_THE_WAR" id="THE_YEAR_AFTER_THE_WAR">THE YEAR AFTER THE WAR.</a></h2>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapt.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">The last year of the war I had left Crete on a leave
of absence of two months, which was extended
indefinitely by Mr. Washburn, then Secretary of
State, on account of the health of my family; but in April
my wife, broken by the hardships of our Cretan life and
sick-bed watching; and dejected greatly by the loss of a
cause in which she had the most passionate sympathy,
and by the misery of the unhappy Cretans around us,
became insane and ended her life.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Mr. Fish, now become Secretary of State,
removed me from the consulate at the request of the
Turkish Government, and in June I went to Crete to hand
over the consular effects to my successor, and, on the petition
of the Cretan chiefs still remaining in Athens, to obtain,
if possible, some mitigation of the measures which prevented
them from repatriating themselves. I found the island
as I had left it, in peace indeed, but the peace of destruction
and paralysis. Roads were being made, and block-houses
being constructed, but no houses being rebuilt, and
the roads were all military. The new Governor-General
seemed amiable, just, and good-willed, but in Turkish disorganization
the best will does not go far. The subordinates
of the local administration were the spies, the traitors,
and "loyal" people of the war, with rancors to vent and
revenges to take. There was nothing to rob the people of,
but there remained prisons and persecutions.</p>

<p>I found, naturally enough, all my efforts with the Governor
useless, and that the condition of things made return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
unsafe for any one who had taken a prominent part in the
war; and so, despairing of finding any opening, I was about to
return to Athens without awaiting my successor, but before
going decided to make that visit to Omalos and Samaria
which the insurrection had stopped and the state of hostilities
ever since had rendered impracticable from the
Turkish posts.</p>

<p>Even when peace had been restored and not a recusant
fugitive remained in the mountain hiding-places, the local
authorities could with difficulty reconcile themselves to the
idea of my going there; and it was only after the failure
of several petty intrigues to prevent my getting away, that
they determined to pass to the other extreme and do handsomely
what they could not avoid doing. I set out in the
dawn of a July day with an officer of the mounted police,
a chosen and trusty man, with one private of the same
force and my own cavass. The private rode a hundred
yards ahead <i lang="fr">en vidette</i> against any attack on the official
dignity by unknowing peasant or unheeding patrol or straggler
of the faithful, and discharged his duty on the road
to my complete satisfaction, no countermarching troops
daring to hold the narrow way to the detriment of the consular
dignity. The lawlessness of the Turkish administration
in Crete has kept alive, more than in most of the
Christian provinces of the Ottoman Empire, the power of
and respect for foreign officials. Just as much as the
unjust Governor dreads the inspecting eye and the exposing
blue-book, so much the Rayah hopes from them, and
honors the Effendi as the Turk curses the Ghiaour; and so
in Crete the extreme of official deference is kept up, corresponding
to the degree of official oppression hitherto
obtaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>So, when my <i lang="fr">avant-courrier</i> announced to the awkward
squad of Anatolian infantry, ragged, sullen, that the "Consolos
Bey" demanded the road, a savage frown of unwelcome
gleamed through the disciplinary respect; while the
shouting, chattering groups of Christian peasants ambling
along on the mules and donkeys, with their little loads of
fowls or oil for the market at Canéa, were generally arrested
by the summons of the guard, and drew up respectfully
at the roadside, the most respectful dismounting until
I had passed.</p>

<p>The road for ten or twelve miles runs westward over a
level plain, the ancient bed of the Iardanos, by whose
banks we know, from Homer, that the Cydonians dwelt.
The fact that the Iardanos (now called Platanos, from the
immense plane-trees growing on its banks) now empties
into the sea ten miles from Canéa, has puzzled geographers
to reconcile Cydonia with Canéa; but, on arriving at the
point where the river debouches into and cuts across the
plain, it will be seen that the new channel to the sea has
been cut through the hills by the action of the river, and
that the ancient course was evidently eastward through the
still marshy plain into the bay of Suda, passing close to the
position of Canéa.</p>

<p>The roads in Crete are marked with historical associations
of all ages, as the Appian Way with recollections of
the great dead. The town that we pass, near the mouth
of the Platanos, was the ancient Pergamos, whither Lycurgus,
to evade the possibility of his laws being revoked, banished
himself, where he died, and was buried. The town
which we enter as we cross the Platanos at the ford is
Alikianu, the scene of that atrocious and perfidious massacre
of which I have told the story. It is a town of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>half ruinedd
villas&mdash;some, of the Venetian days&mdash;buried in orange-trees,
and so surrounded with olive groves that but
little of it can be seen from the river. The road we must
follow only skirts it, following the river, until it rises on a
ridge of mountains, zigzag and undulating, up to Lakus.
The Lakiotes are accounted among the bravest of the Cretans;
and though military science, flank movements, and
artillery made their town untenable in the late insurrection,
it is still a formidable position. The village itself
lies along under the summit ridge of the chain of hills
which form a buttress to the Asprovouna, stretching north,
with steep approaches from every side. It used to be
a prosperous village, one of the largest in the island,
but now its straggling houses were in ruins, two or three
only having the roofs replaced, others having only a
canopy of boughs laid over one end of the space enclosed
by the blackened walls, enough to keep the dews off while
the inhabitants slept, for rain never falls here through the
summer months. All bespoke utter exhaustion and extreme
poverty. The jaded, listless look of the people, the
demoralization of war and exile, most of them having been
of the refugees in Greece, the ravage and misery of all surroundings,
made a picture which never has passed from my
memory.</p>

<p>In the first capture by Mustapha Pasha, Lakus was taken
by surprise and a flank movement of the Turkish irregulars,
the Lakiotes having only time to secure their most
valuable and portable goods and bury the church-bell, retiring
up the mountain slopes beyond, firing a few shots
of defiance as they went. When A'ali Pasha arrived in
Crete, he ordered the reconstruction of the church of Lakus,
demolished by the Turks at the capture of the village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and the primates were ordered to find the bell. Declining
to know its whereabouts, they were thrown into prison, to
lie until they did, a few days of which treatment produced
the desired effect, and the bell was hung over the reconstructed
church. That afternoon notes of compulsory joy
sounded from the belfry, and the insurgents from the ridge
of Zourba opposite came down to the brink of the ravine to
ask who had betrayed the bell. Their submitted townsmen
replied by an avowal of the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> of getting
at the required knowledge; and the "patriots" replied,
"Ring away. We will come and ring it to-night." And
agreeably to promise, a band of insurgents came across the
ravine at midnight, carried off the bell, and, hanging it on
a tree near Zourba, rang the night out. The Turkish
guard, which occupied the block-house in the village,
scarcely thought it worth while to risk the defence of the
bell, if indeed they knew of its danger.</p>

<p>At Lakus I had made my plans to breakfast and pass the
noon-heat, but I had reckoned without my hosts, for, on
"pitching my tent" and sending out my cavass to find a
lamb to roast, I found evidence of the inroads of civilization&mdash;I
could not get one for less than three pounds sterling&mdash;about
fifteen times the usual price, and a sure attempt
at swindle based on my supposed necessities. Fortunately
my escort had amply provided themselves, and
we had bread and cheese, caviar and coffee, to stay our appetites
until we should reach Omalos, where were a garrison
and an army butcher. So I ate my modicum of what they
gave me, smoked my cigarette, and tried to doze, while the
chattering villagers, holding themselves aloof in reminiscent
dread of the Moslem, mingled their hum with that
of the bees from the hives near us. My "tent" was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
ancient mulberry-tree above, and a Persian carpet beneath;
and, though I tried to sleep away the time, I did nothing
but listen to the story my cavass, Hadji Houssein, was telling
his companions of the adventure we had had the year
before in the valley below, and which, lest he have not
given the true version, I will tell as it happened.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the valley at our feet lies the village of
Meskla, built along the banks of the Platanos, where it is
a pure, cold, rushing mountain brook, of which, in any other
part of the world, the eddies would have been alive with
trout, but in which now there are only, as in all other Cretan
rivers, eels. A party of official personages in Canéa,
including her Britannic Majesty's consul, myself, the American
ditto, with the captain and officers of the English and
French gunboats on the station, and an English colonel
in the Turkish army, had made a picnic party to Meskla,
in August of the last year of the war. The Turkish troops
held Lakus and Omalos and the western bank of the
Platanos down to the plain; but the insurgents still remained
in possession of all the northern spurs of the Asprovouna,
from Lakus east for twenty miles, including
Zourba; and, while we drank toasts and ate our roast-lamb
under the plane-trees by the river, a perpetual
peppering of rifles was going on from the hill-tops on
each side of the valley above. Was it fighting, or was
it fun? I began to climb one of the nearest spurs on the
Turkish side of the ravine to see, and, not to be suspected
of both sides, took my way to the picket of Turkish irregulars,
which, sheltered by a group of trees on the summit,
was firing across the valley in a desultory way. As I showed
myself in one of the windings of the path to the patriots
at Zourba, I saw the smoke-puff of a rifle on the edge of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
ravine, and the ball glanced along the rocks within three
feet, spattering the lead over me in a most convincing way.
I naturally made a flank movement, which shortly degenerated
into the retrograde of a satisfied curiosity.</p>

<p>The incident had a side interest to the whole party, for it
showed us that the road we proposed to take might be dangerous,
the more as we had a Turkish officer and his two attendants
in uniform in our company. We had purposed
following the river up still higher, and then crossing the
ridge to Theriso.</p>

<p>Consulting one of the submitted Meskliotes, who waited
his chance for the <i lang="fr">débris</i> of the picnic, we were informed
that it would be very far from safe to follow our proposed
route, which was exposed in its whole line to the chance
of shots from the main mountain ridge; but he offered to
guide us by a road running along the side of the ridge furthest
from the insurgents, and where he could warn any
outposts of them that we were coming. This road was a
fair sample of those which existed in Crete before the war, a
mere bridle-path scratched in the slope of a huge landslide,
which rose above us two or three hundred feet, and
descended three or four times that distance into the bed of
the Platanos. Part of it was too dizzy and dangerous to
ride, and we led our beasts hesitating and hobbling along.
We were soon amongst the outposts of the insurgents, as we
had unmistakable evidence on arriving at Theriso, where
we found a detachment of a dozen or more rough, motley-looking
fellows, armed with all kinds of guns, and clad in
all ways except well. They looked askance at our fez-wearing
colonel and his two cavalrymen, but from respect
for the consular presences respected <em>their</em> persons. We
drank with them at the spring, exchanged identifications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and pursued our way down the celebrated ravine, the scene
of two terrible disasters to the Turkish army during different
insurrections. Nothing can be more uncomfortable, in
a military point of view, than one of these Cretan ravines.
Cut in the limestone rock by the glacier torrents of ages,
zigzag in their courses, and shut between abrupt ridges,
with no road but an unsatisfactory bridle-path, the troop
which is incautious enough to enter without crowning the
heights on each side as it advances is certain to be
hemmed in, and to be severely treated by a comparatively
small foe or exterminated by a large one.</p>

<p>We had delayed too long, and, as we entered the most
precipitous portion of the ravine, the red sunlight on the
eastern cliffs told us that the sun, long shut from direct
view, was sinking; and in our haste we missed the way,
and fell into a vineyard-path, out of any line of travel. Immediately
we heard voices hailing us from the hill-tops, to
which we paid no attention, thinking them the cries of
shepherd-boys, and continued until we found ourselves in a
maze of vineyards, and the path and sun gone at the same
instant. Now the hailing began with bullets. The uniforms
of our Turkish escort demanded explanation, and as our
guides had left us at Theriso we were helpless. To go
back and explain was to be a better mark, and to march
ahead, anywhere, was our only chance. Unfortunately,
Hadji, who carried my hunting rifle, considered it his military
duty to return the fire, and in a few moments, other
pickets coming in, we had about forty sharpshooters popping
away at us in the twilight. Our further passage was shut
by an abrupt hillside, along which we must make a movement
by the flank toward the road we had lost, and directly
across the line of fire. The sound of the bullets suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>ed
getting to cover, and as all path had now disappeared
we dismounted and led our beasts at random, no one
knowing where we were going or should go, and only aiming
to turn the point of the ridge above us, to get out of
the fire, which was increasing, and the pinging of Enfield
bullets over our heads was a wonderful inducer of celerity.
It was a veritable <i lang="fr">sauve qui peut</i>. I saw men of war ducking
and dodging at every flash and whistle in a way that
indicated small faith in the doctrine of chances, according
to which a thousand shots must be fired for one to hit. We
found, at length, where the ridge broke down, a maze of
huge rocks, affording shelter, but beyond was a deep declivity,
down which in the dark we could see nothing;
further on again was the river, along which the road led.
We could hear the shouts and occasional shots of a detachment
running down the road to intercept us, and another
coming along the ridge above us. My mule was
dead-beat, and could scarcely put one leg before another,
and few others were better off. A short council showed
two minds in the party&mdash;one to lie still to be taken, with
the chance of a shot first; the other to push on for the
road before the insurgents reached it. The only danger
of any moment was to Colonel Borthwick and his Turks,
who would be prizes of war, and to me the chance of a
fever from lying out all night. The majority, nine, voted
with me to go on, and, abandoning mules and horses, we
plunged, without measuring our steps, down the slope, falling,
slipping, tripping over rocks, in bogs, through overtopping
swamp-grass, bushes (for the hillside was a bed
of springs), pushing to strike the road before the insurgents
should head us off, so as to be able to choose our moment
for parleying. I knew if I could get there first, saving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
chance, that all would be well; if a rash boy of fourteen
saw me first, I might be stopped by a bullet before any explanation
would avail.</p>

<p>Tired, muddy, reeking with perspiration, bruised on the
stones, exhausted with haste and trepidation, we won the
race, and halted behind a little roadside chapel to gather
the state of things. Above, we heard voices of a colloquy,
and knew that the remainder of the party were in safe custody,
and our road was quiet. A short walk brought us
to the outpost of the Turkish army, a village garrisoned by
a couple of companies of regulars and a few Albanians.
The commandant, a major, was outranked by Borthwick,
who ordered him at once to send out a detachment to rescue
Consul Dickson and his companions. The poor major
protested and remonstrated, but in vain. "It was dangerous,"
he said; but the colonel insisted, he ordered out a
detachment, and then called for pipes and coffee, after
which, under a heavy escort, we started for Canéa. Borthwick
obtained a battalion of the regulars in garrison, and
started next morning at early dawn to rescue our friends;
but no persuasion could induce the Turkish commander to
enter the ravines. He posted his troops along the overlooking
ridge and waited in ambush. I have it on Borthwick's
word that, while the troops were lying concealed,
under orders to keep the most profound silence, a hare
started up at the end of the line, and the Turkish commander
instantly ordered the first company to their feet, and
to make ready, and was about to give the order to fire
when a hound of the battalion anticipated the volley by
catching the poor beast and despatching him on the spot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dickson and his companions were in the
hospitable hands of a party of Hadji Michali's men, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
about eight <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> came down the road into view of the ambush,
escorted by a guard of honor of insurgents, none the
worse for their adventure, and bringing back our beasts
and baggage; but nothing would induce the Turkish officer
to go the mile separating him from the insurgent outpost
which had fired on us.</p>

<p>While Hadji told his story to his admiring companions
(he was an excellent <i lang="fr">raconteur</i>, and put the whole of his
barbaric soul into the narration, though his respect for the
Effendi kept his voice low and quieted a little his camp
manner), one or the other of the three made my cigarettes
and brought me fire, and only when the sun began to sink
from the meridian did we move on.</p>

<p>As we passed the blockhouse, I found that the General-in-Chief
had preceded me, and given orders that the honors
due to a consular personage&mdash;the same as those paid to a
superior officer in their own army&mdash;should be carefully observed,
and so we had the whole garrison of each blockhouse
on the way out at the "Present arms!" The road
not only zigzags going from Lakus to the plain of Omalos,
but makes such ascents and descents as well accounted for
the fruitlessness of so many attempts to enter the plain,
which is a sort of portico to Samaria. But now a fair
artillery road followed the ridges up to the very plain, and
blockhouses covered with their fire every point where an
ambush could be made, and those little glens, famous in
Cretan tradition for extermination of Turkish detachments,
will never again help native heroism against organized conquest.
We passed, in one of the wildest gorges through
which the road passes, a blockhouse perched high on a
hill-top like an eyrie, a peripatetic atom on the parapet of
which caught my eye, as a wild goat might have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
amongst the cliffs around. As we came into sight, looking
again, I saw the garrison swarming down the hillside
amongst the rocks like ants, wondered what they were at,
and rode on, when at another turn the officer said, "They
salute, Effendi!" I looked around, and, only on his indication,
saw drawn up in rank, hundreds of feet above me,
a line of animalcules, which, by good eyesight, I could
perceive was the whole garrison presenting arms, and they
so continued presenting until, after turn upon turn of the
road, they disappeared from view definitively, when I suppose
they swarmed back to their fastness.</p>

<p>We passed through the ravine of Phokes, where Hadji
Michali once caught a small detachment which incautiously
attempted to penetrate to Omalos. I had heard the story
of the fight, told at the time by an Albanian who was in
it, in a brief but graphic way. The Christians waited invisible,
he said, till the troops were in the bottom of the
ravine, and then began to fire from many directions. The
troops stopped, made a show of resistance, and then broke
and made for the blockhouse at Lakus; "and those who
couldn't run well never got there," he interjected laconically.
He frankly admitted that he was so far in advance
that he saw very little actual fighting, and made no halt,
nor did any others, Mussulman or Christian, till they arrived
at the door of the blockhouse, which he was surprised
at their shutting in time to keep out the Christians.</p>

<p>It was well into the afternoon when we entered the plain
of Omalos, evidently a filled-up crater, its level about five
thousand feet above the sea. The snows and rains of
winter and spring flood it, and as no stream runs from it
the waters disappear by a Katavothron&mdash;a gloomy Acherontic
recess&mdash;into whose crooked recesses the eye cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
pierce, and down whose depths is heard a perpetual cavernous
roaring of water.</p>

<p>In the plain was no vestige of human habitation visible,
except the tents of a battalion of regulars, and a two-story
blockhouse on a spur of hill which projected into the
plain. We rode into the camp, and were received with
emphasis by the Pasha, who, with true Eastern diplomacy,
expressed unbounded, surprise at my visit, "so entirely unexpected;"
and, learning the result of my attempts at feeding
in Lakus, called to the mess-boy to bring me the
remains of the breakfast, apologizing abundantly, and
informing me that I should be expected to dine with him
and the commander of the post at eight. The residual
breakfast, supplemented by a plate of kibaubs, the mutton-chop
of the East, despatched; the ceremonial pipes and
coffee finished, and the more than usually complimentary
speeches said, the shadows meanwhile falling longer on
the plain; I accepted the Pasha's offer of a fresh horse,
and rode across to the famous descent into the glen of
Samaria, the Xyloscala, so-called from a zigzag colossal
staircase made with fir-trunks, and formerly the only means
of descent into the glen. There was a detachment of
troops building a blockhouse to command the upper part
of the glen, and the commander kept me salaaming, coffee-taking,
etc., until I saw that the sunlight was getting too
red to give me time to explore the ravine, and I contented
myself with a look from the brink down into the blue
depths.</p>

<p>I doubt if, in the range of habitual travel, there is another
such scene. It was as if the mountains had gaped
to their very bases. In front of me were bare stony peaks
7,000 to 8,000 feet high, whose precipitous slopes plunged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
down unbrokenly, the pines venturing to show themselves
in increasing number as the slope ascended, and ended in
a narrow gorge. At the side, the rock rose like the aiguilles
of Chamouny, cloven and guttered, with the snow still
lying in its clefts, and broad fields of it on the opposite
eastern peaks. I looked down through the pines and
cedars that clung in the crevices of the rocks below me,
and the bottom of the glen looked blue and faint
in their interstices. The Xyloscala, destroyed by the
insurgents at the beginning of the insurrection, was replaced
by a laborious zigzag road, which sidled off under
crags, and came back along slopes, blasted out of rock,
and buttressed up with pines, seeming to me, where I stood,
as if it finally launched off into mid-air, and would only
help another Dædalus into the mystery of the labyrinth of
pines and rock gorges below.</p>

<p>As I watched, the flame of the sunlight crept up the
peaks across the glen, the purple-blue shadow following it
up, changing the snow-fields from rosy to blue, and the
peaks of pale-gray rock to russet, as the day died away.
The chill of night reminded me to put my overcoat on.
We rode back across the plain in the twilight, accompanied
by the building gang, whose polyglot murmur was as
cheerful and full of mirth as though they were peasants
going home from the vintage.</p>

<p>Nothing can surpass the good-humor and patience of
the Turkish soldier. Brutal and barbarous they doubtless
were when their fanaticism and the rage of battle united
to excite them, but in camp and in peace I have found
them always models of the purely physical man.</p>

<p>Our dinner was luxurious, and in the true Eastern manner.
The Pasha, the Bey commanding the place, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
aide-de-camp made four with me, and one dish, placed in
the middle of the table, served our fingers or spoons according
as the viand was dressed, each one of the four
scrupulously adhering to his quadrant of the copper circle.
The dinner was almost interminable; it was dark and cold
when the end did come.</p>

<p>The soldiers, gathered round their camp some half a
mile away, had eaten their suppers and were at ease, the
shouting of their merriment coming to us occasionally
above the general hum. Presently we saw them taking
fir-branches, and, each lighting one at the nearest campfire,
come running to us at full speed, making a long madcap
procession of torch-bearers, the pitchy fir giving out
an immense flame; and, making for the headquarters, followed
by the battalion band playing, they threw their
branches in a pile on a level space before the Pasha's
tent, and then, turning to the right and left, sat down in a
semicircle open towards us. A detachment was told off
to keep up the fire, and a sort of glee club, accompanied
by rude instruments, drums beaten by the hand, and a kind
of flute and mandolin, commenced singing at the top of
their voices the plaintive monotonous songs which all
who have been in the East know.</p>

<p>This was the overture to a terpsichorean and dramatic
entertainment most unique and amusing. The programme
opened with a dance of Zebeques, the barbarous race who
occupy the country behind Smyrna. They are wrapped
in a sash from the armpits to the hips, with a sort of baggy
knee-breeches, and bearing long knives thrust crosswise
through their sashes. They formed a circle, and began a
movement which seemed like a dance of men in armor,
half stage-stride and half hop. The music struck up an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
appropriate air, and the dancers, joining in the song, circled
slowly two or three times in the same staid and
deliberate manner, then, drawing their knives, brandished
them in time, quickening their pace, and hurrying around
quicker and quicker as the song grew more excited, when
they finally came to a climax of fury, rushing in on each
other at the centre of the circle as if to cut each other
down. But the raised knives were arrested by the opposing
empty hands; and, the paroxysm passed, the song
died down to its lower tone and moderate time, and the
dance began a new movement, each dancer thrusting his
knife into the ground at the centre, and then repeated the
quickening circles; this time, rushing, at the climax, on
their knives and drawing them from the earth, they threw
themselves on an imaginary enemy outside the circle, and,
having hypothetically demolished him, returned to their
gyrations, varying the finale by lifting one of the company
into the air on their hands, and dropping him simultaneously
with their voices. This lasted half an hour.</p>

<p>After an intermission, in which the soldiers, unawed by
the presence of the Pasha, laughed and joked and shouted
to their content, a soldier entered the circle dressed as
an Egyptian dancing woman. He was one of the tallest
men in the regiment, capitally travestied, and all who have
seen the dance of the Almah can imagine the bursts of
laughter with which his grave, precise imitation of one of
them was received by the circle. I have never seen anything
more exquisitely ludicrous. His figure seemed lithe as
a willow-wand, and he twisted and bent, and bowed and
doubled, with the peculiar expression of physique which
seemed impossible to any other than the slender Egyptian
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Roars of applause followed this performance, and the
next was a pantomime&mdash;"The Honey-Stealers." Two
men enter dressed as peasants, one carrying a gun on his
back, and begin groping about as in the dark, run
against each other, stumble and fall, and finally, by much
listening, find a box, which had been placed to represent
the hive. The thief lays down his gun to be more free in
his motions, and a soldier runs into the circle and carries
it off. Enter presently a third honey-seeker, blacked
to represent a negro or some diabolical personage, it was
impossible to say which, and, stumbling on the other two,
an affray ensues, in the course of which the bees get disturbed,
and come out in swarms, the luckless black getting the
lion's share of the stings. At this moment an alarm is given,
and the gunner misses his gun, upon which he falls on
the black as the thief, and between the stings and the
blows the intruder expires, the play ending with the efforts
of the two living to carry out and dispose of the one dead,
interfered with greatly by a spasmodic life remaining in
the members, which refuse to lie as they are put. But this
finally subsiding, the body is satisfactorily disposed of, and
the pantomime gives way, amid the most uproarious laughter
and applause, to a Circassian dance. The dancers
were few, and the dance tame, and, not meeting any appreciation,
gave way to a repetition of the Zebeque saltations,
of which they seemed never disposed to tire.</p>

<p>The entertainment lasted till eleven o'clock, when, each
soldier taking a branch of fir, the actors and audience
raced off like a demoniac festival breaking up, the band
following with a blare of trumpets and bang of drums,
and we were left to our dignity and the dying embers
of the theatre fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Although in July, the night was so intensely cold that,
sharing the Pasha's tent, and with all the covering he could
spare me, in addition to my own Persian carpet over instead
of under me, I was almost too cold to sleep, and the
morning found me well disposed to put my blood in motion
by vigorous exercise. Coffee served, we rode over
to the Xyloscala, and, after more coffee-and-pipe compliments,
we began the descent of the new zigzag road. It
was so steep that no loaded beast could mount it, and it
took me two hours' walk to get to the bottom, where the
road straightens and follows the river, here a dancing, gurgling
stream, rushing amongst boulders and over ridges, under
overhanging pines, as though there were no tropics and
the land had not had rain for two months. The whole
gorge was filled with the balsamic odors of firs and pine,
which covered the slopes wherever the rock would give
them place; and above that, bare splintery cliffs overhung
the gorge, so that it seemed that a stone would fall three
thousand feet if thrown from the summit. A few Turkish
soldiers, lazily felling or trimming pines for the blockhouses,
were the only signs of humanity we saw. Above, in the
pines, we heard the partridge's note, as the mother called to
her young brood to follow her. The gorge widened to a glen;
the slopes receded slightly, and then, after another hour of
walking, we came to a sharp turn in its course, where the
high mountains walled up the glen to the east with a sheer
slope of five or six thousand feet from the peaks to the
brook bed, and the rocks on each side shut in like the lintels
of a doorway. Here is the little village of Samaria, so long
the refuge of the women and children of this section of
Crete, and where, so long as arms and food lasted, a few
resolute men might have defended them against all comers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
I doubt if in the known world there is such another fortress.
No artillery could crown those heights, no athletes
descend the slopes; while the only access from below is
through the river-bed, in one place only ten feet wide, and
above which the cliffs rise perpendicularly over a thousand
feet; the strata in some places matching each other, so
that it seems to have been a cloven gorge&mdash;the yawn of
some earthquake, which suggested closing again at a future
day&mdash;and for two hours down from the glen there is no
escaping from the river course, except by goat-paths, and
these such as no goat would care needlessly to travel.</p>

<p>Pashley has described the village of Samaria, and its magnificent
cypresses and little chapel, as they are now. No
destruction, no sacrilege, has entered there; and perhaps
this is the only church in Crete, outside the Turkish
lines of permanent occupation, which has not been desecrated.
The roof of the chapel is made of tiles, which
must date from the early Byzantine Empire.</p>

<p>The river below here, the St. Roumeli, is a rapid perennial
stream, which at times of flood shuts off all travel by the
road. Lower down is a tiny village of the same name as
the river, in a gorge into which only an hour's sunlight
can enter during the day&mdash;damp, chilly, and aguish&mdash;the
residence of a half-dozen families of goat-herds. Pashley
identifies a site near the mouth of the river as that of Tarrha,
the scene of Apollo's loves with Acacallis, who, if bred
in this glen, must have been of that icy temperament which
should have best suited the professional flirt of Olympus.</p>

<p>To travellers who care to visit Samaria, I would give the
hint to leave their horses at Omalos, and have a boat to
meet them at the mouth of the St. Roumeli, as the ascent
is long and painful, even by the new road, which, since I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
saw it the torrents may have demolished. They may thus
visit the Port Phœnix of St. Paul, which lies a few miles to
the eastward, and landing at Suia, west of St. Roumeli,
have their horses come down by the pass of Krustogherako,
and so return by way of St. Irene&mdash;a very wild pass
of the Selinos mountains&mdash;to Canéa.</p>

<p>We had made no such provision, and so we were obliged
to toil back in the intense heat of the July sun beating
down into the gorge, and, arriving past noon, to be refreshed
by sherbet and coffee by the hospitable commander of the
station at Xyloscala, the snow of the sherbet being brought
from the opposite cliff two hundred yards away, but an
hour's climb to get to it. The commander was a more intelligent
man than it is usual for Turkish officers to be, and
he related how during the insurrection he had led a detachment
round to the top of the opposing cliffs, and how
when they got there they were like the twenty thousand
men of the King of France, and had to come back by the
way they went.</p>

<p>However, they have now a blockhouse at the Xyloscala,
another at Samaria in sight and signalling of it, and a
third at St. Roumeli, so that, for the future, there need be
no doubt as to who holds the Heart of Crete.</p>

<p>The night's discomforts had been too great to allow me
to spend another in Omalos, so, after a slight detour to
look at the immense wild pear-trees which grow on the
plains, we rode directly back to Canéa, accompanied by
the Pasha. Meeting the priest of Lakus by the way, I
gave the village a vicarious berating for having in such an
ungrateful manner refused hospitality to a man who had
been their advocate and friend so long, and whom they
had obliged to go back to their enemies and his for a din<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>ner.
He seemed much ashamed, and the day after I
received a profound apology from the primates pleading
ignorance of my personality.</p>

<p>I improved the acquaintance with the Pasha (Mehmet
Ali, "the Prussian," so-called from his race, though he
was brought up from boyhood as a Mussulman), whom I
found more intelligent and liberal than any Turkish official
I had met with, except A'ali and Server Effendi, to
introduce the condition of the chiefs of the insurrection
remaining in exile, many of them old and worn out, afflicted
with the nostalgia which mountain people know so
well, and ready to submit unreservedly to the government.
A nominal amnesty had been granted, relieving all from
any political prosecution, but not from the civil suits for
damages, etc., which might be brought against the chiefs
who had taken sheep or cattle or destroyed any property.
Two or three of the chiefs who had returned had already
been thrown into prison on suits of this kind, and as the
complainants were always adherents of the government
through the war, and all the minor officials were of that
class whose loyalty had been beyond question from the
beginning, a civil suit had pretty much the same color as a
political persecution. This state of things effectually prevented
the return of any of the prominent personages of
the insurrection, who, living in exile, were reasons of the
strongest against the restoration of tranquillity, and made
a convenient appliance for agitation and renewed strife
on any disturbance of the political atmosphere of Europe.</p>

<p>My only interest was the restoration of the island to
such peace as was possible, and this Mehmet Ali comprehended,
and, throwing aside all hostility, he entered into
the discussion of the positions, and on a subsequent inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>view
begged me to go to Constantinople and place the
matter before A'ali Pasha, to whom he gave me a letter of
introduction.</p>

<p>I accordingly went to Constantinople, and was received
in the kindest and most considerate manner by the Grand
Vizier, to whom I stated at length my ideas of the difficulties
of the pacification, and at his request made a memoir
of all the facts and motives involved, with a description
of the class of men to whom was entrusted the
carrying out of the measures by which the Porte had hoped
to conciliate the Cretans, embittered political and religious
adversaries, full of wrath at the losses and indignities they
had suffered, and more anxious to avenge their own
wrongs than to secure the true interest of the Porte. He
begged me to wait until he could send to Crete and obtain
a report on my memoir, and, as he found on its receipt that
my assertion was just, he promised to correct the abuses
of administration, and proposed to me to go to Crete to
superintend the carrying out of the measures which seemed
necessary to restore the confidence of the late insurgents,
pledging himself to accord complete immunity to any
individuals whom I should designate as possessing my confidence,
and offering me a stipend more than sufficient for
all my needs in the service. I knew that so long as he
was Grand Vizier I could depend on the fulfilment of
these promises, but, in the event of any change of administration,
the understanding between us would fail as between
his successor and myself. I demanded, therefore,
a comprehensive measure securing all the insurgents from
civil suits on account of acts of war committed during the
insurrection, as a condition of my acceptance of the official
position thus created for me. This the Grand Vizier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
declared the government could not grant without assuming
all the personal liabilities thus discharged, which he
was not willing to recommend, and so, after several interviews
and thorough discussion, I was obliged to decline
the offer made me, much to my regret, for the islanders
had ever a place in my regard, which, with the interest of
common suffering and loss, the years of advocacy of rights
kept back and redress denied, and perhaps the personal
attachment I had found for me and mine in so many of
them, disposed me to make any effort in my making to
secure their good. But to engage my faith and influence
with them on such uncertain grounds as the continuance
in power of a Grand Vizier, or the maintenance of harmony
between myself and the local administration, was too great
a risk for a prudent man, unwilling to engage others in a
position from which he might not have the power to extricate
them.</p>

<p>It was with such a pain as the waiting of my own sentence
of exile would have given me that I went to meet
the old captains on my return to Athens, and told them that
there was no hope of their repatriation through my efforts
at least. I never shall forget the silent despair in the face
of old Costa Belondaki, tall and straight under his seventy-odd
years, white-haired, and meagre, but alert as a man of
forty, as he turned from me when he got his sentence. As
with his elder compatriots, the mountain nostalgia fevered
him and the idle exile broke his spirit, but I could give
him no hope that in his day European civilization or
Turkish administration would be wise enough to economize
his devotion to his country, and make use of rather than
crush the spirit which makes Crete rebellious while its
government is criminal.</p>

<p class="center">PETITION FROM THE LATE CRETAN GREEK
ASSEMBLY TO THE SULTAN.</p>


<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">To His Imperial August Majesty, our Sovereign
Abdul Aziz Khan.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Majesty</span>: We, the humble undersigned, having been
specially delegated by the whole Christian population of
Crete to avail ourselves of the benevolent and philanthropic
intentions which the Imperial Government have at
all times evinced towards this island, now take the
liberty to lay at the feet of your Imperial Majesty the
following humble prayer, in the hope that the same may
be favorably acceded to:</p>

<p>1. And in the first place, we humbly pray to be relieved
from the exorbitant duties levied on all articles of food
since the year 1858 up to this day. Contrary to the concessions
made to us, verbally and in writing, not only
have the duties in question been increased, but new ones
have been added, namely, the duties on salt, tobacco,
snuff, wine, and spirits, on land rents, porterage, on sales
of real and personal property, on sales of animals in general,
on weighing, on stamps (which last are particularly
heavy), those on dyeing, on sales of fish and meat, etc.,
and, finally, various others which are onerous and unjust.</p>

<p>We are, moreover, able to prove by statistical accounts
that within the last two years we have paid what, with
duties and taxes, would exceed the amount of our incomes.
Above all things, then, the system of taxation
requires imperial solicitude, like unto the care a father
would bestow on his dutiful children. The mode of levying
duties also requires reform.</p>

<p>The system of farming in operation is not only vexa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>tious
and perplexing to the population, but is also baneful
to the Imperial Government, inasmuch as the farmers,
being bound in sureties, one for the other, at the time of
the sale of the articles by public auction incur greater responsibility
than they are able to meet when their obligations
become due. Hence they oppress the taxpayer by
fraudulently exacting more than they ought, while, on the
other hand, they often quit the island secretly, thus both
damaging their sureties and entailing loss on the public
treasury.</p>

<p>The unequal system of levying the taxes in all the provinces
of the island, which is contrary to the spirit of the
Tanzimat published by the Imperial Government, and
which latter secures equal rights to all your Imperial Majesty's
subjects indiscriminately, also requires amending.</p>

<p>We humbly pray your Imperial Majesty that the district
of Sfakia, hitherto exempt from taxation owing to the
barrenness and sterility of its soil, may continue to enjoy
the same privilege.</p>

<p>2. We humbly submit, for the consideration of your Imperial
Majesty, the utter want of means of communication
throughout the interior of the island, and the absence of
bridges, whereby the conveying of produce from one part
to another is materially impeded, and many persons are
annually drowned in the rivers.</p>

<p>3. We humbly venture to submit to your Imperial Majesty
that the concessions granted to us by your illustrious
predecessor in 1858, through the medium of the distinguished
delegates sent hither, be put into execution.</p>

<p>It is true that we possess a Demogerondia, Councils,
and Heads of Communities ("Ephoria"), but when we are
called upon to exercise the right of election, our charter,
which to all appearances exists, becomes in fact a dead
letter. We venture to suggest that the last Regulation,
which refers to the mode of electing the members of the
Demogerondia and Councils, is defective, and therefore
requires modification.</p>

<p>4. We beseech your Imperial Majesty graciously to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>sider
the evils to which we are subject in consequence of
the possessors of oil stores assuming to be money-lenders,
but who are, indeed, monopolists, thus selling the produce
of the island at half its value.</p>

<p>As it frequently happens that the crops fail, we are compelled
to pay double the price, having under pressure
already effected the sale of such produce.</p>

<p>We trust, therefore, that this system be abolished, and
a bank duly established, for which latter the Hatti-Humayoun
duly provides in its 29th paragraph.</p>

<p>5. We venture to submit to the paternal solicitude of
your Imperial Majesty the deplorable condition of the
local tribunals. Unprovided as these are with a general
code, the form of procedure observed therein is necessarily
irregular. In corroboration of this allegation, we
assert that many have been persecuted, while no redress
has been granted to those who have so suffered. We are
enabled to enumerate various abuses which have occurred
in every province. Hence, every branch of these law-courts
requires amendment, so that on a sentence being
awarded no undue favor shall be shown to the stronger
party, or the creed of the individual be made to serve as
a bias, as happened to some of the inhabitants of Kritza,
Lasithe, and others. In that affair the Khaniollis family,
having at one time held the produce of "malikianeh" or
the tithes, presumed to consider themselves sole proprietors
of that privilege, and went so far as to take possession
of half of the property of Kritza, and nearly the whole
of that of Lasithe, and some other. In consequence of
such a proceeding, the inhabitants of the last-quoted village
incurred considerable expense in the defence of their
rights, and otherwise suffered grievously. Examples of
this kind are not wanting in the Provinces of Retimo and
Canéa.</p>

<p>Moreover, the sentences of the local tribunals used formerly
to be drawn up in Turkish and Greek; but nowadays,
although the vernacular be modern Greek throughout
the island, no judicial award, or any other official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
document, must be written out in Greek, but merely in Turkish;
a fact at once perplexing to both parties at suit, as
also to the judicial and other administrative offices.</p>

<p>We consequently entreat of your Imperial Majesty that
the use of the modern Greek and Turkish languages be
freely permitted to all classes.</p>

<p>At the Mekhemeh the testimony of a Christian is held
invalid against that of a Mohammedan. This is contrary
to the letter and spirit of the Hatti-Humayoun, which removes
all legal disabilities from the non-Mussulman subjects
of your Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p>6. From your Imperial Majesty we look forward with
hope and confidence to obtain our personal liberties. At
present, this depends entirely upon the discretion of the
Honorable Governors and officers charged with the Imperial
Government. A simple pretext is sufficient to cause
the imprisonment of the most respectable man, and without
sentence being awarded to him he may be detained
there for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>7. We humbly request the attention of your Imperial
Majesty to the want of schools in the villages belonging
to the three provinces, and we pray that any teacher, irrespective
of his nationality, be allowed to exercise his
profession in the provinces as well as in the towns, and
that the hospitals may be properly looked after.</p>

<p>8. Another drawback which impedes the prosperity of
our island is the closing of the numerous ports with which
Nature has so bountifully supplied it; and while in all
countries of the world commerce has been materially developed
by the reduction of duties, we are obliged, after
long journeys, and after being exposed to the inclemency
of the seasons, to convey our produce to one of the three
principal fortresses of the island. The opening, therefore,
of all the ports for the free importation and exportation
of produce and general merchandise would greatly contribute
to our well-being.</p>

<p>9. The liberty of worship, in virtue of the provisions of
the Hatti-Humayoun, exists only by name in Crete, since,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
on a Greek becoming Mussulman, he is allowed to remain
in the island, and inherit property; whereas if a Turk be
converted to Christianity, he must forthwith quit the
island, and forfeit all his rights.</p>

<p>10. Majesty! Similar griefs we, two years ago, took the
liberty of submitting to the clemency of your Imperial
Majesty, when were added such disproportionate duties
and taxes on food, and when the privileges conceded to
us in 1858 were violated; but unfortunately, and contrary
to every hope, we were not listened to, and although even
to-day we may have been obliged from higher motives to
assemble, in order to give utterance to our grievances,
we hope that for such reason we shall not be considered
disturbers of the public peace, such imputation the local
Governor-General, in his Excellency's proclamation of the
28th of April last, having ascribed to us.</p>

<p>On the other hand, perceiving as we do warlike preparations,
while our gathering has altogether been a peaceful
one, and presuming that the same has been misrepresented
to the Imperial Government, we entreat of your
Imperial Majesty a general pardon for all those who may
have taken part in the present popular movement.</p>

<p>With a view to an impartial investigation of all the
above-stated grievances on the part of your Imperial Majesty's
faithful subjects in this island, we venture to submit
that an upright person be sent hither for the purpose.</p>

<p>We beg leave to express a hope that your Imperial Majesty
may take pity on this poor people, who suffers so unjustly,
and who implores that its prayer may be soon
transmitted to your Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p>From this day we raise our voices for the long life and
happiness of your Imperial Majesty, and we shall never
cease to hope for an improvement in our condition under
the powerful ægis of the Imperial Government.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Candia, having taken an active part

which, begun in 1821, has continued through many
years, succeeded, at great sacrifice, in making themselves
masters of the island and of Grambousse, one of its principal
fortresses.</p>

<p>Consequently, they hoped that, enjoying the same
rights as their brethren of the Continent of Greece, their
efforts would have been crowned by the consecration of
their independence, but the three Great Powers in their
wisdom decided otherwise. The Cretans, heartbroken,
submitted to this decision, and since then have dragged
on their existence, at one time under the sovereignty of
the Pasha of Egypt, at another under that of his Majesty
the Sultan.</p>

<p>In recommending to us to submit to this decision of
Europe, the President of Greece, the late Count Capodistria,
who was greatly interested in us, led us to hope that
this great misfortune would be of short duration, and that
in a short while our wishes would be fulfilled. On the
other hand, we received solemn promises that we should
be governed in a kindly manner.</p>

<p>Thirty-five years have elapsed since then, and during
this long period our existence has not ceased to be exposed
to every kind of oppressive injustice and misfortune.
Not a traveller has visited our beautiful but unfortunate
country without being touched by our sufferings.</p>

<p>We pay enormous taxes, which are increased each year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
without enjoying any of the advantages which all nations
receive in return for such taxation. Justice is a thing
unheard of. We have no tribunals worthy of that name;
nor have we any laws. Our government depends on the
arbitrary will of the representative of the Sublime Porte.
Our children, from want of public instruction, wallow in
ignorance; the few schools we have are maintained at our
own small means. The clergy are even paid by us. We
are not admitted into the public service. We have no
roads or bridges. Our evidence is of no avail against that
of a Mussulman. The excesses committed by the Turks
are rarely punished. We have never experienced any of
the advantages enjoyed by the poorest subjects of civilized
nations. We are the slaves of another race.</p>

<p>The population of this unfortunate country, being unable
to bend itself to this state of things, has several
times since 1830 found itself forced in its despair to have
recourse to arms to recover its rights. At this present
time it has again risen, and in abstaining from all acts of
violence, it peaceably asks for justice from his Majesty the
Sultan, the reduction of taxes, and an improvement in the
administration. And if we, the most prudent, had not restrained
its impetuosity, the population would have flown
to arms, to engage in its despair in an unequal and sanguinary
contest.</p>

<p>Madam, one of the reasons of state policy which led the
great Powers to replace us under the dominion of Turkey,
was no doubt the amount of the Mussulman population in
our island, which was considered higher than that of the
Christian population.</p>

<p>But now the Turks compose but one-fourth of the whole
population, which amounts to 300,000 souls. It is unjust
that the most numerous should suffer on account of the
lesser number, whereas if we were under a Christian government
our Turkish brethren would enjoy the same
happiness and the same advantages as ourselves.</p>

<p>Moreover, in order to keep the country in subjection,
Turkey is obliged to keep up an army and a fleet, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
spend enormous sums of money, without its being of much
service to her, whereas Crete, if united to Greece, would
confer great advantages on the whole Greek race, and
would be able to embark on a system of civilization. If
the creation of an Hellenic kingdom has for its object the
regeneration of this people, Crete, which is purely Hellenic
country, would become one of its foundation stones.</p>

<p>Madam, long experience has proved that, from the manner
in which our island is governed, all improvement and
all advancement are impossible for this wretched country.</p>

<p>We consequently entreat your Majesty and their Majesties
the Sovereigns of the two other Protecting Powers of
the Greek nation, to deign to excuse our one wish, viz.,
union with our brethren of Greece.</p>

<p>It is only under this condition that we can be happy,
and contribute to the advancement of our race.</p>

<p>Should that, however, be impossible at present, we beg
your Majesty, in your infinite goodness, to endeavor to
obtain for us a political organization, under which there
may be laws and regular tribunals, less grievous and better
imposed taxes, by which the morality of the people
may become possible, that at least one part of the revenues
of the country should be expended on its improvement,
and generally that our just grievances may be redressed
by a Christian and paternal administration.</p>

<p>This is what, in imploring the magnanimous interposition
of your Majesty, we venture to ask of the powerful
monarchs of the three Great Powers.</p>

<p>We sign ourselves, etc.</p>

<p class="hang">OFFICIAL INSTRUCTION TO THE GOVERNOR
OF THE ISLAND OF CRETE, DATED 2 REBI-UL-EVEL,
1283 (JULY 15, 1866).</p>

<p>Your Excellency's despatches, with their enclosures,
forwarded through Kadri Bey on his return from an official
mission to Crete, have arrived, and his report on the
state of affairs, as witnessed by him in that island, has
been thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>It was hoped and expected that the non-Mussulman
inhabitants, who had assembled together in several districts
of the province, would have listened to the benignant
and paternal exhortations of the Imperial Government;
that they would have broken up these assemblies,
and, showing obedience and submission to authority, have
returned to their own homes. And the reluctance of the
Porte up to the present moment to inflict the punishment
due to their offences has been based upon this expectation.
But it appears, on the contrary, that although these
persons have made a show of breaking up their meetings,
yet they have not abandoned their religious proceedings;
and it is evident that at the present time they are still
continuing in the course of excitement and commotion.
Now, according to the sense of the petitions which have
reached the Porte on the part of these persons, both at
the commencement of the affair and subsequently, the object
of these assemblies was to obtain the abolition of certain
duties on such articles as tobacco, snuff, salt, and
stamps; the facilitating of the means of communication
in the island; reform in the election of the Medjliss or
Demogerondia; the prevention of the evil practice of
wearing arms; the formation of schools, hospitals, and
such like institutions.</p>

<p>But besides all these things, they have got certain ideas
into their heads, to which they also now give expression.</p>

<p>Now, from first to last, as is most manifest and natural,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the principal wish of the Imperial Government is to secure
the tranquillity and welfare of all classes of its subjects;
and the inhabitants of Crete especially, and in many
instances, have been the object of concessions and peculiar
favor; above all, in the matter of the property tax
("virgu"), the sheep tax, and such like imposts which are
levied in all other parts of the Ottoman dominions, the inhabitants
of this island have alone been exempted. And up
to the present day the Porte has never entertained the idea
of depriving them of this indulgence. But the inhabitants
of Crete now put forward a claim for the abolition of taxes
which belong to a different category. For, as every one
knows, the Porte some years ago, solely with the view of
increasing the exports from its dominions, and in order to
encourage and facilitate commercial enterprise, agreed to
the abolition of the tax of 12 per cent. on exports to
foreign countries; and owing to the tax being diminished
at the rate of 1 per cent. annually, it will be reduced in
the course of a few years to only 1 per cent. for a permanence.</p>

<p>In consequence of this measure, the loss to the Imperial
treasury amounts to more than 300,000 purses a year.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
The abolition of this tax on exports being of immense benefit
to the people of this empire, in order in some slight
degree to compensate for the loss thus entailed, certain
new taxes of universal application to all parts of the country
were imposed; and as the people of the Island of Crete
are amongst those most benefited by the abolition of the
duty on exports, it is only just and natural that they
should pay their share of the new imposts which were intended
to make up the loss to the treasury. For, whilst
the inhabitants of other places have had 50,000 purses
added to their property tax ("verghi"), in consequence of
no such tax existing in Crete, no part in the payment of
this augmentation falls to their lot. Crete, then, enjoying
as she does this exceptional favor and advantage,
cannot with right and justice pretend to be exempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
from the imposts mentioned above. As regards the matter
of the construction of roads, bridges, hospitals, etc., it
is true that such wishes are amongst the requirements of
the age, and the Porte is exceedingly anxious for the carrying
out of such useful projects. It is clear, moreover,
that all countries and governments stand in need of improvements
of this kind. But their execution can only be
effected by degrees, and according to convenience and
opportunities. If the inhabitants of Crete required such
public works and improvements, then it behooved them to
make application to the Government at Constantinople,
and in a manner consistent with their allegiance. But the
essentially illegal and irregular demand for the abolition
of taxes, the mixing up with this demand of other matters
which might possibly be conceded, and their proceedings
in assembling together for the promotion of these objects,
can only be regarded by intelligent persons as acts of rebellion
which cannot be tolerated, and they have now incurred
the extreme reprobation of the Imperial Government.</p>

<p>In short, from the misconduct of this people up to the
present time in declining to listen to advice, in imputing
probably to erroneous motives the gracious clemency of
his Imperial Majesty, who has hitherto delayed to visit
their offences with punishment, and in preferring to follow
the suggestions of seditious intrigues rather than the
tranquillity and welfare of their families, it has become
manifest that they will not be guided by prudential motives.
Henceforth, then, the Imperial Government is
compelled to perform its duty. A military force will at
once be despatched to a convenient locality, and in the
first instance the orders and resolutions of the Porte will
once more be made known to the inhabitants of Crete,
viz., that in obedience to orders the assemblies should
disperse, and each individual return to his own home
and ordinary occupation, under the protection of the
Sultan; and, if they have any demands to prefer, let
them make them in a wise and decorous manner to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Government. But if they continue in the course explained
above, this will be regarded as a grave offence by
the Government, and they will be dispersed by force and
visited with severe chastisement. Let them understand
this and take warning. Let them break up their assemblies,
and give assurances and obligations in writing to
the effect that they will no more act in contravention of
the principle of submission to authority.</p>

<p>If after this they immediately return to their homes and
occupations, well and good. But if, on the contrary, they
persist in their misconduct, the troops will be sent
against them, and the ringleaders of the sedition will be
arrested and imprisoned in the Sultan's fortresses, while
the rest of the people will be dispersed by force; and, in
the event of their presuming to have recourse to arms,
they will meet with reprisals in kind and be severely
chastised. Should these persons dare to resist to arms, it
will also be necessary to disarm them.</p>

<p>Your Excellency is instructed to execute the measures
necessary in accordance with what is stated above.</p>

<p class="hang">REPLY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE
CRETANS TO THE ANSWER OF THE GRAND
VIZIER TO THEIR PETITION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To His Highness the Grand Vizier</span>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Your Highness</span>: We, the Undersigned, the Representatives
of the Christian population of the Island of Crete,
received yesterday (July 19), after a delay of three
months, the answer of the Imperial Government to the
humble petition we addressed to His Majesty the Sultan,
which answer has been transmitted to us through his Excellency
the Governor-General of Candia.</p>

<p>It is with great pain that we remark the silence kept in
this answer in regard to the chief complaints in our petition&mdash;that
is to say, on what concerns the tribunals, freedom
of worship, personal liberty, the municipal elections,
the use of the Greek language, etc.</p>

<p>It is also with pain and astonishment that we have
learnt by this answer that not only we have no right to
complain of direct and indirect taxes which weigh so
heavily upon us, but that we are in a privileged position,
in so far as regards other subjects of the empire, in reference
to the direct taxes&mdash;viz., the one under the denomination
of "verghi" and that on sheep.</p>

<p>Highness, we take the liberty to again call your kind
attention to the following points:</p>

<p>First. It is all the Christians of Candia, and not some,
as it pleases your Highness to say, who think that they
cannot in any way be compared to other subjects of the
Porte in what concerns the taxes since the period when,
by the advice and under the guarantee of the great Christian
Powers, the Cretans submitted themselves to the
Sublime Porte; and it is notorious that since that period
up to a few years ago they have not paid other taxes,
direct or indirect, beyond tithes and the military tax, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
conformity with the law and decrees. It is true that the duties
on exportation diminish gradually from one per cent.,
as is stated in the answer of the Porte. Nevertheless, in a
country like Crete, where there is no industry, the import
duties, which still remain the same, neutralize the
advantages arising out of the lowering of the export
duties. Such being the case, we not only do not enjoy
the benefits which your Highness is pleased to mention,
but we are still crushed by the exorbitant taxes, which
are far above our means, as is evident from the financial
report of the last two years, during which time we have
paid almost as much in taxes as the amount of our incomes,
without enjoying in return any material advantage.</p>

<p>Secondly. In what concerns roads, schools, and hospitals,
we do not doubt the benevolent intentions of His
Majesty; but the unfortunate inhabitants of Candia see
with sorrow that the execution of these generous intentions
is indefinitely postponed, notwithstanding the oft-repeated
promises of the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p>Thirdly. It is, nevertheless, our sacred duty to protest
openly against the reproach addressed to us by your
Highness, namely, that we had not made known our
complaints to the Imperial Government in a respectful
manner; that we had mixed up claims altogether inadmissible
with those which might be entertained; and
that we had held meetings and made demonstrations
which could not be considered otherwise than treasonable
by all conscientious and impartial persons. To these
reproaches we take the liberty to reply respectfully that
in a country like Crete, where there is no press or parliament,
and that experience has shown that, whenever and
in whatever manner the Christians have sought to obtain
justice from the Sublime Porte, their mouths have been
shut by intimidation and by low intrigues, we had no other
means of bringing our grievances to the knowledge of our
Sovereign, and of acquainting him with the real state of the
country, beyond a recourse to a peaceable meeting without
arms. It is also our bounden duty&mdash;we think so, at least&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
repeat here that all the Christians in Candia, without
exception, took part in this manifestation, and not merely
some of the inhabitants, as was said by the Governor-General,
and which is believed by your Highness.</p>

<p>It would be absurd, your Highness, almost childish, to
assume that the Representatives of the Christian population
of Candia have obeyed or obey the suggestions of
foreigners, and that the Central Committee is exciting the
people and acting in a seditious spirit. Such allegations
are only put forward by those impostors and wicked men
who, whether Mohammedans or Christians, are imbued with
the most hostile feelings towards the Imperial Government
and towards the Candiotes, and are only interested
in imposing upon the goodness of our gracious Sovereign.
It is notorious that the demonstration of the Candiote
people is quite spontaneous, and that the assemblage of
Cretans, far from compromising public tranquillity, was
to upset the projects of such wicked people who seek for
any pretext for calumny.</p>

<p>Finally, we, the undersigned, the Representatives of
the Candiote people, not considering ourselves as rebels,
cannot answer for the future by solemn declarations
("senets") in the name of a people which has only confided
to us expressly and in writing a limited authority, namely,
to forward its petition and to receive the answer which
may be returned thereto.</p>

<p>It is this answer alone which we have in consequence
bound ourselves to bring to the knowledge of the people,
with the fullest confidence in the promises of the Imperial
Government, which has declared that the persons fulfilling
this sacred duty need not fear the threats made to them.
It is for your Highness to arrive at such a decision as may
be dictated by a sense of justice and conscientious feeling.</p>

<p class="hang">TRANSLATION OF AN ADDRESS TO THE EUROPEAN
CONSULS OF THE CHRISTIAN DEPUTIES,
ASSEMBLED UNDER THE NAME OF THE
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF CRETANS, SITTING
AT PROSNERO, CANTON OF APOCORONA.</p>

<p>MM. <span class="smcap">les Consuls</span>: The Representatives of the Christian
people of the Isle of Crete, respectfully undersigned,
assembled under the title of the Assembly General of the
Cretans, feel it our imperative duty to call you to bear
witness to the violence which obliges us, in spite of our
wishes to the contrary, to take up arms by right of lawful
defence.</p>

<p>Greeks by origin and by tongue, having taken part in
the struggle borne by our brothers in 1821 for our national
independence, but yet not having profited by the advantages
of that war, our only object in assembling here is
to claim the enjoyment of the rights which were guaranteed
to us by the three Protecting Powers by Treaties
and Protocols, and of those which His Imperial Majesty
the Sultan deigned spontaneously to decree to us by a
Hatti-Humayoun.</p>

<p>But the Governor-General, changing the meaning and
the point of our humble petition, by which we claimed
pacifically, and without resorting to arms, the execution
of written promises, after leaving us for three months in a
state of uncertainty, finally incited the Porte to return an
unfavorable and menacing answer, and, opposing violence
to right, he appeared before us in arms.</p>

<p>Calling the Representatives of the protecting and guaranteeing
Powers to bear witness to this, we take up arms
for our defence and safety, and we make the Turkish
Government responsible before the civilized world for all
the consequences of the struggle which is about to break
out.</p>

<p class="center">LORD LYONS TO LORD STANLEY.&mdash;(Received
September 7.)</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap"><small>Constantinople</small></span>, <small>August 28, 1866</small>. &nbsp;
</p>

<p>I had, on the 25th instant, the honor to receive your
Lordship's despatches respecting the affairs of Crete, of
the 13th instant.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in obedience to your Lordship's instructions,
I informed A'ali Pasha that Her Majesty's Government
strongly advise the Porte to deal with the Cretans with
the utmost forbearance and in a conciliatory spirit, to
redress any grievances of which they may have cause to
complain, to relieve them from any exceptional treatment
which bears hard upon them, and generally to study to
reconcile them to the Sultan's Government. I added,
that Her Majesty's Government conceive that in the present
state of the Continent of Europe, it would be a great
misfortune to Turkey if any question were to arise which
should excite the sympathies of Europe in favor of the
resistance of Christian subjects of the Sultan to the Ottoman
Government, and that it is manifestly most important
to the interests of the Porte that the Provincial authorities
should be enjoined to act justly and in a kindly spirit
towards the Christians.</p>

<p>A'ali Pasha said that he entirely concurred in the views of
Her Majesty's Government. He told me that it had been
definitively settled that Mustapha Kiritli Pasha should be
sent to Crete with large powers; that this measure would
show the Cretans that their petition had been seriously
taken into consideration by the Sultan; and that he had
reason to hope that order would very soon be restored.</p>

<p>I said that I hoped that Mustapha Pasha's powers were
not merely conferred with a view to quelling the present
resistance of the Christian Cretans, but that they were to
be exerted for the purpose of removing causes of complaint
and placing matters in the island on a footing likely
to be permanently satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>A'ali Pasha said that Mustapha Pasha would be empowered
to take into consideration all reasonable complaints,
which were brought before him in a loyal and dutiful
spirit, but, of course, he would not listen to men unlawfully
assembled in defiance of the Government, and would
repress revolt and treasonable attempts to change the
relation of the island to the Porte. On being further
pressed by me, A'ali Pasha said that no Christian blood had
been shed; that he was confident none would be shed;
and that it was the earnest desire of the Porte to avoid, if
possible, a collision between the troops and the Christians.
He added that he was convinced that the movement was
due to foreign instigation, and that, if that instigation
ceased, it would rapidly subside.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> The real reason for the insistence of the committee on the promise of immunity
was this: A daughter of one of the Pasha's council, his <i lang="fr">âme damnée</i>, a
Cretan, by the name of Petrides, finding one day a list of persons designated for
exile and the bagnio, in which was the name of her lover, a young Cretan, stole
the document and gave it to him. It contained the names of all the prominent
chiefs of the petition movement, and many in the city who were only
known for their liberal opinions.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> Certain European journals, discrediting this atrocity, and, strangely enough,
on the ground that it had really happened in the previous great revolution,
affected to consider all the atrocities as fictitious. The incident repeats itself
in Cretan history, and I had information from European officers of the
Turkish troops of several cases in this war committed under their personal
observation.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> This estimate, and some of the details I give, I received from the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> The few men who were spared from this massacre were those who were
able to appeal to Mustapha Pasha, or some of his suite, on the ground of
ancient personal relations, or who succeeded in obtaining his clemency by
some sufficient plea, after surrender. That all the butchery was not due to
the heat of assault is shown by this and by several incidents reported to me.
One of the latest parties of the combatants who surrendered on a promise of
their lives was passed in review before the Pasha himself, and all who wore
European clothing passed under the sword at once, as volunteers, though
amongst them were several Cretans from the adjacent villages, whose relatives
attested their nativity. When the refectory surrendered, the Pasha swore on
the head of the Sultan to spare its inmates, who were required to hand out all
their arms, and were afterwards butchered, even to the women. Mr. Skinner,
in his "Roughing it in Crete," gives an account of his visit to Arkadi some
months later, when he found the bodies still unburied, and describes the scene
in the refectory with ghastly verity. After the fighting was all over, a party
of irregulars went round with lighted candles, and, holding them to the noses
of the corpses, gave the <i lang="fr">coup de grace</i> to all who breathed. Two Cretans had
managed to hide on the roof of one of the buildings, where they remained till
the next day, when, as the Albanians were leaving, one of them shot a pigeon
which fell on the roof where the Cretans had hid, and, going up to secure his
game, discovered the unfortunates, who were put to death in cold blood. On
the march back to Retimo, all who could not keep up were at once killed, and
those who reached the city were kept for months in prison and in extreme
misery.</p></div>
